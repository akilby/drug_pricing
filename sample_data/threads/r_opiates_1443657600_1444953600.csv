I've been a long time reader of /r/opiates. I got hooked through morbo2000's stories and stuck around because of the community. I love hearing stories from people all over the world what the drug scene/general life is like in their area. 


I've been experimenting with opiates for a little while but would say I have little to no tolerance. I've done 10-15mg of oxy a few times when drinking and felt good but never really felt like I've had enough to get really high.

I recently got 0.2g of #4 that is supposedly standard to good for what is available on the street in Australia. From what I've read 10-20mg should be good to start off with.

Last night I sniffed 10mg, waited half an hour and did another 10mg.
I felt a little bit heavy but nothing really amazing. I smoke weed daily and had held off to feel the full effects. About an hour after dosing I smoked and it intensified the high a little bit. 

About 15 minutes after sniffing I felt a bit of it slide down my throat. Is this usual? I'm used to it from other drugs but I'd read to do it differently to everything else and had tried to sniff as lightly as possible. 


What are your tips for keeping as much in your nose as possible?


I'm going to a party tomorrow night and want to do enough to be nice and high but don't want to be nodding or anything as my friends don't know what I'm up to. 

Do you think I'll be alright to start off with a 30mg bump and have more in a few hours? Should I start with more considering my test last night? 


Has anyone tried both Aus and US dope? I'm interested as everyone seems to use bigger doses there than what is recommended here but I've heard mixed reports about which is stronger for street grade stuff.

I obviously want to be safe but am getting sick of only ever half experiencing an opiate high. 

Thanks for reading. Hope you're having a good day. ",1443711057.0

Why oh why does this happen to me. 

My choice is Hydromorph Contin. However I usually do like 12 to 18 mg. Latley been doing a lot if 8mg ones because they've been around and are generally cheaper( though not by much) then a 12 but these 8s are what they call "" Hearts"" around here. They are Triangle and pretty much dissolve, leaving very very little traces in the spoon, therefore you're getting a pretty much clear and pure shot. 

Anywhooser, I've even been doing 4's and the like as well, just because I just started working again( seasonal) and been broke, so ai can only buy enough that'll keep me well at work.   
Anyway about once a week maybe twice, I'll come across enough to be able to buy a 12 or two.  

Point is when I do these small amounts, I usually always feel a pretty good rush. Moreso from the 12's but I feel a minor rush from the fours and 8s as well.
So I get paid yesterday and bought four 18's 2 for me and 2 for wife . 

Having had a morphine that morning, and having a hell if w long ass day t work, I was exhausted so I did a bit and saved myself about a good 26 mg. Which I just did.  Here's my problem.  Seems whenever I do more then like a 15 or so, its almost like I barely feel any rush.  I mean yeah I know my body and I know that if I do for a couple days, it starts to lose its feeling more and more till I clean up for about a week. But in this case, I did like 2 mg at 5 in the morning and felt it decent enough for a  mg shot. But no, this was an 24 or so shot and I got a rush but not really what I was expecting. 

Seems I get more if a rush of a smaller amount

Same thing happened a couple weeks back, I bought a 30 mg and II actually posted here about the color of it. Thinking I had been ripped off.  Anyway, so what's the deal? Anyone else get this?

I will point out that I am high as fuxk though as I've nodded several times trying to write this post. 

Sorry for the rambling.  

Happy nods all. 

Oh one more thing, I have a theroy that when I have small amounts, the reason I feel the rush more is because I know its only going to be a small one, so I appreciate it for what it is, but I also don't expect to get much out if it,  so when I feel a rush it ends up feeling like more then I prepped myself for.",1443708106.0

My main supplier sells Oxycodone 30mg ir's for $20 a pop. as well as Morphine ER 60mg at $12 a pop. I use to prefer the Oxycodone all day because as we know it's stronger and can be prepared for multiple ROA's. But recently that's switched. 

One day all he had was the Morphine so I bought 5 and took those 300mgs orally not expecting much but I was blown away by not only how high and nodded out I got but by how long it lasted. I'm talking take a 300mg 11am dose and still feeling it with a slighter nod at 8pm. Sometimes even going into the next day if taken a little later. 3 blues just aren't what they use to be anymore. I'd have to take 2 orally and rail 1 and get a good nod and be high for maybe 2 hours. 3 if I'm lucky. Now yes, I've IV'd his Morphines before through a tedious process of removing the filler and gunk and all that and I found when I did that to just 1 of those pills I'd get an EXTREME rush. Having to grasp the bathroom counter kind of rush followed by NO high. Stone sober. It was like just injecting a rush. 

3 IR Oxy 30s and 5 ER Morphine 60s both cost 60$ I want your guy's input on this. Is there any way to add to the duration of the high of a Morphines 60mg IV? I love blues but I'm trying to get the best bang for my buck since there's so very few of those bucks. I've IV'd the blues too and found now benefit from using that ROA. My fear is that I'm at the mercy of pharmacology i.e I'm ingesting 300mg of Morphine orally so the high is lasting longer and the nod is stronger due to its similar structure to opium. And IVing is skipping being broken down in the liver and going straight to my bloodstream thus being excreted quicker as well.

What do you guys think? $12 for a Morphine ER 60mg is that price because they are weak and tough to abuse as opposed to Oxycodone. I'm looking for way to stretch it out more to where it's no question about where my $60 is going. Any input is appreciated. 

Disclaimer: DO NOT go into your grandma's medicine cabinet and grab 5 of her Morphines and toss them back. It's taken me a while to get to this point of not having 300mg of Morphine killing me and even so it was stupid of me to take that much.  And this was done in the middle of a massive binge so please, be careful. And stay safe.

First on to mine, and I'm not trying to brag. I'm sure there are people on here that have had way worse. 

I guess mine would have to be when I was doing opana and fent. This was the first time I had found opana. My dude who would sell me Roxis sold me the 10mg instant release opanas for $5 each. He thought they were 10mg IR oxycodone. Fuck dude, I had so much fun with these. The first time I shot one it was like dilaudid kicked me in the balls and oxy was holding on to my legs. I ended up getting bad off on these due to the cheap price, doing 150-200mg a day. I was also sprinkling in fent along with every shot. I had ordered a gram of fent and never really measured anything out. I had a few close calls but never ODd on the shit. 

The first WD's I had from this shit blew me away. I was curled up into a ball throwing up and shitting everywhere. It felt like I was constantly getting shot up with everclear and ice running through my veins. Though these were the worst withdrawals I've ever had, they lasted MAYBE three days. After that, the storm had started to calm. 

I wanna hear stories. I go to rehab Friday, and I have a few vials of dilaudid and morphine on the way to my door right now. About to shoot so much dilaudid my spine falls asleep. Benzo WD stories, tell them too!

3n0fpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3n0fpt/two_year_anniversary/,10,https://redd.it/3n0fpt,fringelife,Two year anniversary,"Exactly two years ago, I was riding my bike home from work. At work late afternoons we have free beer and snacks (besides that and the pay, the job was god fucking awful), and since I hated my job I always stuffed a six pack in my bag and grabbed a beer to drink during the ride home. I'm a huge stoner so I always carry my g pen with me (and hit it on the ride home). As I get off the road and into a residential area with a bike path and no cars, beer in my right hand, I grab my g pen with my left and start riding my bike with no hands.


Out of nowhere, a seamless delivery guy whips around a blind corner going 20mph the wrong way on his bike heading straight for me (he had one of those electric motors on his bike, anyone from NYC knows what I'm talking about). Since I'm double fisting G pen in one hand and beer in the other, I throw the beer to try to hit my brakes and avoid crashing. Unfortunately the guy at the same time tries swerving but like an idiot swerves into my direction (whereas if he had continued going straight we would have been fine) and hits me directly. 


I flip over on my bike and with my dumb luck land RIGHT on the broken beer bottle I just tossed. My hand hurts a little, and I dislocate my shoulder at the same time. While I'm in shock from the accident and can't really feel the pain in my shoulder, I decide to pop my shoulder back in and head back home. 


All of a sudden, a crowd gathers around me asking if I'm okay, if they need to call an ambulance. I hear people whispering ""shit he looks bad"". I'm all confused, thinking that while a dislocated shoulder really sucks, it's not like I broke anything or can't move, I'm just in pain. A couple runs up, and the woman says to me calmly but sternly ""Sir, you really need to sit down"". Still confused, I tell her I'm alright, it's no big deal, I'm double jointed in a lot of places and I've dislocated things before. She gives me a weird look, and then tells me to look at my hand. I look down, see my shirt is drenched in blood, and I start worrying the delivery guy was hurt really badly and start to look around and then HOLY SHIT MY HAND IS SPRAYING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. It's sliced open from the base of my pinky to bottom of my palm and a goop of muscle and tendon is dangling out.


I freak out, scream at the top of my lungs, and immediately fall on my ass into a pool of blood. It looks like someone was gutted. How could this happen from my falling onto a piece of glass??? Paramedics arrive, bandage me up, and ask if I have family that can come to the hospital. I move my hand very slightly, and I can feel the skin open up, and more blood pours out through the bandage. The paramedics tell me I've lost at least a quarter of my blood and I may need a blood transfusion. It's my sisters birthday and she JUST got in town to visit me and friends, so luckily she's around in case I need her blood.


I get to the ER, and the doctors have to apply even more pressure to stop the bleeding. The pressure is painful - they didn't clean out all the shards of glass, but they can't relieve any of it without risking me losing even more blood. I'm screaming in pain, and notice my hand is turning a darker and darker shade of purple - they've cut off circulation. I ask them to relieve it, but they can't. The doctor gives me a shot of morphine, my first taste of any opiates. 10 minutes go by and I ask them ""when am I supposed to start feeling this?"" And the nurses are confused - it's instantaneous they tell me. I'm still in agonizing pain, and my hand is outright numb and dark purple at this point. They give me another shot of morphine - still feel nothing.


The doctor tells the nurse ""fentanyl, now"". I ask, ""fentanyl, what the hell is that? Am I going to be okay????"" As they give me the shot, the doctor says to me ""we can't relieve the pressure or you'll lose too much blood, but your circulation is getting cut off, and the hand surgery team is tied up with a worker who sawed half his hand off. We may need to amputate your pinky and ring finger if the bleeding won't stop."" As the shot of fentanyl hits me, a wave of euphoric apathy washed me over. I start laughing and tell the team ""cut my fingers off??!? When then I guess you'll have to call me Stumps!!"" They all start laughing too! It was the funniest joke I've ever told I thought.


At the time, I was dating a girl who was still in college in another city two hours away, but we were having troubles. I asked my best friend who met me at the hospital to call her, let her know what happened, see if she would come. She's concerned, but not enough to come to the hospital. I'll pay for your bus ticket, I'm just scared, I don't want to lose my fingers, will you please come? No, she's got a lot going on, she'll see me again soon though. It's been two hours since that shot of fentanyl, and it's wearing off fast. I'm sad, really sad. I could have died, I might lose my fingers, and the woman I love won't even come to see me. The pain is overwhelming again, and I start crying out again. The nurse hits me with another shot - wow, it's not so bad that my girl won't come. I'll be alright, I don't need her, I have my best friend and my sister right here anyway.


Fast forward two days, and after surgery and several shots of fentanyl, the doctors save my fingers with my hand relatively intact. Two people next to me in ICU I get a script for oxycodone, and get sent on my merry way. They gave it to me for the physical pain, but over the next two weeks I find myself smoking weed for the physical pain, and taking the pills more for the emotional pain of my girlfriend not being there for me - the realization that our relationship is really over.


It's been exactly two years since that incident, and I've yet to actually catch an addiction, and I'm rather proud of myself, because it's really hard not to. I know I'm (psychologically) addicted to weed, and many family members of mine have had problems with opiates (among other drugs), so I know opiate addiction is always a pervasive threat. Since then I've only dabbled with hydro, oxy, PST, and in recent months small amounts of H, and managed to keep my use spread out enough to avoid having any problems.


I'm not really sure what the point of my post is here, but I guess I just wanted to tell someone about how and why I started using, and hopefully get some moral support to keep using responsibly. My girlfriend now knows I use some opiates, but doesn't realize how frequently, and definitely doesn't know about the H. I've had some hard times lately, and the urge to use a lot more frequently has been a lot stronger than usual.


I've managed to successfully chip for the last two years, so here's to another two years (and lifetime) to healthy opiate use. Good luck to you all, fiends and chippers alike!


Tl;dr: Two years ago today I had my first taste of opiates after a painful and potentially life changing but ultimately minor bicycle accident. I realized the power of that euphoric apathy, and it helped me to stop caring that a loved one didn't visit me while I was in the hospital. I've managed to use responsibly over these two years, and while sometimes it's harder to do so than at other times, I haven't given in to the temptation to use too often (yet, but hopefully never). I've been having a rough time in the last few weeks with loss, family issues, and my mental health, and the urge to use irresponsibly has been stronger than usual. Here's to hoping I can get through the recent pain, and keep on chipping for another two years (and hopefully the rest of my life!). Good luck to you all, chippers and fiends alike!",1443644358.0

Based on outward appearances, it would seem that my life is better, but not really. So I make an appointment with the Doctor I was seeing before I got locked up.  He had me on 8 mg. dillys, 2mg. xanaxs, 60 mg. MsContin, Adderrall, the list goes on.  So during our appointment, he tells me how much things have changed and that he doesn't prescribe a lot of the meds he did in the past.  So what he gives me is 30 zubsolv tablets for pain (new type of suboxone), 2 mg. of Klonipin DAILY, and 20 mg. of Evekkeo daily (new type of adderral).  Does anyone have any experience with Zubsolv or Evekkeo ?  The plus side was he gave me coupons for the new meds and I only had to pay for the Klonipin (saving $530) so I was able to complete my relapse and buy a gram and some points. However,  I don't plan on making a habit out of the opiate use, it was just an itch that needed to be scratched.

What are some of your tips and tricks...

The best one I can give you is if you have REAL dirty seeds wash them five or six times, drink wash of first three rinses and save the last three rinses to wash your next batch of seeds in. Also, you can use the same water to wash multiple pounds leaving you with a thick, dark brown liquid that is so concentrated you only need to fill a shot glass a couple of times.

I have used many different drugs, been seriously hooked on heroin, meth, benzos, and subs. I used to be a regular poster, but deleted my account as part of getting away from H.

I had heard of using lope during withdrawal, but I never tried it. My reasoning was that compared to my major symptoms, diarrhea just wasn't that bad. My wd featured sweats, kicks, anxiety/depression, and severe pains. Kratom, ibuprofen, valerian, all barely dented any of it. 

These days my subs only last halfway to my next script, and sub withdrawal is potent as well. However, this time I stumbled upon a bluelight thread about lope. Apparently high dose (see my edit below) loperamide could ease many wd symptoms, not just stomach problems. Having tried 8mg of the otc opiate, it takes away  95% of the severity of my symptoms. EVEN THE MENTAL ONES. 

Without getting too deep into the pharmacology of it, lope is a cousin of fentanyl. It's otc because it gets pumped out of the brain and CNS as soon as it enters, leaving only peripheral effects (similarly, L-methamphetamine is sold at every drugstore). The prevailing concensus is that high doses bombarding a system DO leak into the CNS, resulting in abating wd symptoms. 

So far I've found that it doesn't seem to prolong wd length, such as taking a full opiate would. And, my plumbing has been a bit sluggish, but I have had no difficulty taking care of business when the time finally comes. 

So, I suggest giving it a try if you haven't. I can't believe I went through all my time having not tried it. 

Tldr: lope works wonders for many people in wd

EDIT: ok, so let's define our dosing parameters. When I say ""high doses"", I'm talking 8-40mg. Those whom are posting evidence of health problems resulting from ""high doses of loperamide"" are generally talking about doses above 100mg taken often over an extended period of time. As one commenter points out, any time a person is taking 50 or more tablets at a time (in some cases, 400 tablets at a time), of course health problems will result. OK, you can go back to nodding now. ",1443801448.0

I really need your help to plan how to quit H. It's not really a taper, I only have one dose left (I only insufflate) but I have a few other substances to help me out. Ok I'll just get right to it, here's all the relevant information I can think of.
I've been snorting H since late april/early may of this year. Predictably, my tolerance has risen and at this point I need roughly half a ball (in my country, a ball is ~0.1 grams) to feel ""ok"" and an entire ball to get me sort of high. These past couple of weeks, I've been using roughly 3-4 balls a day, so that's 0.4 grams a day, and if I take the last line at ~8 pm it keeps withdrawals away completely until the morning when I take my first line of the day.

I've been sober twice during this period, once in the beginning of the summer and once at the end of the summer. Both times were due to me going on a trip and, stupidly, using all that I had to quickly. The first time I was sober for 10 days, the acute withdrawal symptoms were present for the first 4 days, after that I was somewhat ok but all I could think of was the H I was going to buy when I got back. The second time was basically the same, I was sober for a week and the minute I got home I went and bought more. I really hated withdrawals (though I know it's probably nothing compared to an IV user with a gram-a-day habit) which is why I want to try to lessen the withdrawal symptoms as much as possible this time.
To help me out, I've got a few other substances, and the reason I am writing this post is because I need your help in figuring out how to make the most of what I've got, seeing as it isn't a lot. So here's my supply:

25 mg Diazepam (2x 10mg, 1x 5mg) 

450 mg Pregabalin (3x 150mg Lyrica) 

8/2 mg Buprenorphine/Naloxone (1x 8/2mg Suboxone) 

A nug of weed.

So what do you think is the best way to do this? Seeing as my dosages aren't super high (as I said, 0.3-0.4 grams lasts me ~1.5 days without even a hint of going into withdrawals) I was thinking that I could try to make the Suboxone last as long as possible. Should I save the Lyrica and Diazepam to boost the Suboxone in order to being able to take a smaller dose of Sub? Or should I use some of the Lyrica and Diazepam to boost the last H I've got so that I can make that last as long as possible so that I don't need as much Sub when I am going into withdrawals? Or should I use the Lyrica and Diazepam when I am waiting for the time to pass before I can use my Suboxone (also, should I wait 12 hours before taking it? 24 hours?).

I guess that's all the information I can give you, if you're wondering anything else just ask. I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to help me out with this so that I don't fuck up and end up in withdrawals after having used up all the Sub/Lyrica/Diazepam and go out to get more H.",1443798726.0

I have a complicated problem with the inner workings of my leg and hip that requires blood thinners among other meds, and the Oxycodone was the only pain killer I could take that wouldn't interfere with those other necessary meds.
I feel like this medicine makes me feel worse even than the pain. I can't not take it if I have an ok pain day because I get the most excruciatingly withdrawal symptoms. Every morning I wake up in withdrawal (the supposed 12 hour lasting tablets only last about 8 hours and the liquid isn't enough to cover it). I can't get going for hours, because then I take the tablet, and when it kicks in it just knocks me out and I have to sleep for another 2 hours.

My life is just over. I used to be successful and happy and out and about doing lots of things. Now I just can't do anything. Can't function, I can't be awake properly or have the energy to move my body. I am constantly trying to balance the feelings in my body to makes sure they are at least comfortable. I tried to come off the medicine slowly, but it was unbearable. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm in a prison of terrible agony and my doctor just doesn't know why this med would be making me feel so bad.

I'm just now learning that he passed away in July. He was one of my best friends. He lived with me to ""get clean"" before moving back to Indiana with his parents...then he went back and kept meeting up with people on here, possibly under a different username (I remember him telling me he made another account). He would call me about four times a week to talk about his life; half the time it was something about wanting to do right by his family and stay clean--the rest of the time it was about how he'd have no trouble chipping and wanted to get high.

The last time I talked to him he called me at midnight to say he'd fought with his parents and was thinking he'd move out. He told me he was planning on copping and he'd call me afterward...I told him to be careful and he'd told me not to worry. I never heard from him again.

His parents found him in his room on July 19th, unconscious. He was in a coma for a week before they pulled the plug. His parents just now went into his accounts, found my info from his LinkedIn and sent me a message...

My gut had already told me something happened. I can't believe I'm just now finding out, but I guess I sort of knew already. I told myself he was in rehab, or even jail... but I knew. I just had no real way of finding out, save searching his obituary once a week (for some reason it never came up).

What I realized is: I was constantly focusing on the future and worrying about what *will* happen & what I *will* do, and instead I need to accept situations as they are, and make a CONSCIOUS effort to be fully mentally present in the moment that is 'now'. 

When I did this sober, I felt like it was easier to avoid cravings because I could just go through my day thinking only about what I was doing at that certain time. It was more simple to go through my day without thinking ""I should get high, I should get high, how am i going to get high"" 

I began using again out of choice, I wanted to do opiates again, plain and simple, I wanted to feel the penultimate warmth of the acute influx of dopamine again... Who doesn't? :P

There's no use in just tripping about the next high. Take a deep breath, enjoy the moment you're in, it's beautiful and temporary, feel it all, and when it's nearly gone, THEN it's time to decide what to do next. 

I don't know if this made sense to anyone else, but my life has gotten so much better since I adopted this system of thinking, so I thought I'd better share it.

I’m in bed and the world seems to be pressing in. Anxiety of what is coming the next week has been racing through my mind for the past 36 hours. Right now I stink, I haven’t showered or eaten a thing all weekend. I’m wearing a sweater over a soaked tee shirt and my underwear is sticking to me like took a shower with them on. I’m going from sweating to shivering minute by minute. Going to the bathroom to sit on a cold toilet seat to shit my brains out is complete torture. The cold shocks me like I’m sitting in an ice bath, at this point the restless one kick me hard, it knows I’m weak and it knows I have no choice. 

For the first time I cry out loud for it to stop. Please stop. Embarrassingly I hope no one heard me, no one real at least. It doesn’t help at all.

I make my way to the medicine cabinet. Passing my family on the way, they don’t even acknowledge I’m there, I don’t really know if I am or not to tell you the truth. I’ve been in and out, trying to keep my eyes closed as long as I can while fighting off the restless body. Sleep came in short waves the night before. I dreamt of awful things I don’t want to recall but they haunt my thoughts every time it’s quite. I can’t make sense of what I saw or why but the feeling it left is like a dark pit I can’t escape. No matter how many times I’m at the edge clamoring to get out it grows and swallows me up. The darkness, the vines, and the figures it hides is like nothing I have ever seen in my life, I don’t know where they come from or why my mind makes them so much stronger then me but they are.

My hand’s shake, the chills shoot through me as I try to drink some water. Even though it is room temperature if feels like frozen knives. I make my way back upstairs, lock myself away in the spare room, soaked clothing on the floor, I don’t have the strength to move them. I lay down and stick that pill under my tongue. In an hour I will feel better or worse, as I wait I close my eyes and let the dark pit and its inhabitants swallow me whole and tear my apart one more time, someone help me.",1443719179.0

And most likely they have smoked weed before they did heroin and probably really liked it. But for a lot of people who are physically dependent on a strong opiate do not really care for weed. Now I've been doing opiates for 5 years and dope for 3 but I always loved to mix the combo because it would act as a catalyst for the nod. And in my opinion the best nods evolve weed and maybe a benzo I don't over do it though with benzos, because I like to remember what happened yesterday, even on my days off I don't really get why people want to black out, but to each his own. Now I will admit I've had a couple of bad experiences smoking weed to ease withdrawal. When you get to the throwing up, body aches, diarrhea stage in the withdrawal  the weed does wonders to help your eat and ease pain. But when u enter the nauseous stage and when all the mental and emotional withdrawals, that's a different animal. This is the worst part because all that emotional pain you've numbed starts coming back. The many times I had to cold turkey on my own for Jobs and my PO. Now when you smoke weed in this stage, it could be very dangerous based on my experiences especially if you over do it. Now this story is long I need to type shit I was speedballing so only read if you want to it might be funny I didn't read because it's my way to vent when I'm high as shit and night doing anything social. The worst experience I had was when I was 18 and I was determined to quit this time, and I was on day 4, I felt depressed and miserable so I went to my friends house to smoke this sweet bong he had. I'm not one to be really obsessed with different brand name bongs, but I know his was an illadelph bong because he would always tell people that illadelph bongs are now made in Cali and he has the older philly made one. It was pretty sweet. Anyway I remember playing ps2 and then the bong came to me. Now for some reason i torched that bowl but I didn't even want to because I knew I'd get too fucked up withdrawing. But after first rip I felt relaxed until the bong came to me a couple more times. Eventually I became so high I couldn't play the video game. Then I did the worst thing I got in my head and started thinking about how I've been injecting drugs in my vain every day. Like really deep thinking and it was starting to make me feel like a piece of shit. I can't fully explain my thought process on this with out sounding crazy , I guess I was feeling extreme shame for the fact that literally everything that I thought I would never do with drugs a year ago all happened. It really made me look at what my life was like from an outsiders perspective and I felt like a savage/animalistic with all the weird shooting up rituals I would do when using alone. Oh and before it got really intense I took an ambien to calm my brain, well this actually made it better for a little until we went out on my friends deck to smoke dabs. Big mistake, even when I'm not in an emotional breakdown I have a tendency to overdue dabs, I ended up doing a good amount and now I'm panicing not really noticeable to someone else but in my head. I was sitting at this table with my friends when my one buddy brad can be quit annoying when high. He just keeps on talking about useless information that none of will remember except him. But I love the kid that's what makes him brad. I was taking classes at penn state, not the big one, a satellite location in my area. And brad is a fresh drop out of South Carolina college and explaining that college is a failing system and can do more harm than benefits. And for some people in college parting 24/7 never do any home work and cheat whenever possible. And then all of a sudden I got light head and I started sweating like crazy. So blazed out of my mind I decided to go to the bathroom just to splash some water on my face to get a grip so I get up and to go inside. Well I got up and felt the blood going to my legs and then walked to the door and then something weird happened I didn't open the door but closed my eyes for a second. I was in a dream like state, nah it was more of a nightmare I think I must've been 20 years older because I remember still living with my parents and I was loading this sketchy shot on the couch. And my mom sitting right across from me while I didn't care at all. My mom says, ""I wish you wouldn't do that in the living room but if u must"" she then reaches in her purse and throws me a screw on needle with a very think gauge and a decent amount of ware. I screwed the tip in then rolled up my sleeve and my arm was tattooed solid black I was about to shoot it when I looked up and asked my mom where dad was. And she looked angry and said come on Brandon why can't you accept your father is passed away. I said sorry and carefully asked how it happened. And my mom said your never gonna accept this are you. You know how he died Brandon you got into an argument about drugs and u said that dad was a weak man and could never deal with battling an addiction. Then he said you know your wrong son your the weak one what did u ever battle or actually work hard towards. If this went on when I was your age it might has been hard but I have an athlete mind that doesn't give in and you son want the easy way out. Then you put drugs and a needle on the table. And then I saw what happened and it was frightening to the extreme my dad was like ok this what you want right, your whole family of junkies. He had this look of madman at this point and ripped 4 bags into the spoon and then spit in the spoon to mix it he seemed like a demon as he had black eyes. Then he ripped out some chest hair and rolled it into a ball and filtered with his hair . Then he goes to the mirror and puts it right in his neck. Then after that he started convulsing and all his vines were popping out. It was really frightening and for some reason I couldn't get up to help him. Then all of a sudden I came to and my friend Mikey was dragging me to a couch. I asked what happened to my other friend dale. He said u got stuck at the door a stood there for a minute and then you fainted and started seizing and making weird noises. But about 25 min of laying on the couch and felt a lot better about my self it was kind of a spiritual experience looking back at it. Now how do you guys feel about weed before and after being dependent on, or frequent use of opiates. I love smoking weed now I'm on subs and only do other hard shit on the weekends. ",1443863168.0

I actually didn't leave to pick up, I just left because how shitty the rehab was. Wasn't really that much recovery going on, and more fights and people getting arrested every day. They also cut me off of all my meds, including the anti depressants and anxiety meds I needed for my anxiety attacks. Hell, they was even a fight between a staff member and a client. Once I was home I started going back to NA since I was trying my damnest not to go back to using. After a week or 2 I realized it was going to be inevitable I was going to relapse eventually.

I went back on kratom maintenance and things have been going ok from now and I'm 55 days clean.

I've read a lot of comments about hustling, the receipt scams at big stores, the grocery scams, hitting up the cash limit on your credit card, it's nasty shi, right?

Well, here's something I do as a little investment to make some cashola on the side; I go to thrift shops in the area (I'm in Seattle so we have a shit ton off em) & grab any name brand or popular fad items on the 50% off THIS COLOR TICKET days, & resell them on ebay, or more perrferably, Craigslist to escape the listing fees & PayPal/shipping bull on ebay. EBay used to be the shit to sell on but now it's all jacked up on fees & fake disputes & garbage. Even OfferUp, a popular app on Driod & Apple, used to sell local crapola, works well!

On Craigslist, I can list ""lot"" items, like 5 pairs of Men's 30x32s classic Levis for $$, & meet up personally with the buyer to collect mah cash. I've never got scammed or felt uncomfortable meeting up, I usually do it in a public parking lot, all that jazz. 

It might seem to be a slow investment of an extra $5-20 here & there, but I can legit make $100-$150 profit with this every week. That's profit, on top of the initial investments of like $20-30 for the thrift goods. 

It is time consuming, about 3-4 hours of my day each day thrifting, listing & meeting, but it's cold hard cash I don't have to claim on taxes, & I can still work a full time job while doing this. Having your own transportation makes this 90% easier for me, so keep that in mind. 

You know what brands are hot right now, & thrift shops near the ritzy neighborhoods & colleges are bank. I find Raybans thrifted almost every other day, & 9 times out of 10 the people pricing these items at the shops don't know the worth really. I've found some sick Hall & Oats vinyls that I sold, tons of functioning Xbox360s & gaming accessories (GH & Rockband guitars are usually $5, but you can sell them for $20-$30 because they aren't manufactured anymore), even found a signed copy of Twilight with author authenticity card. All consoles & electronic devices are tested or fixed by me before I will turn them though, nothing worse than selling broken or fake shit. Sometimes it happens, fake purses are hard to spot nowadays, but I try to do my research via mobile in the shops before purchasing so I can confidently say they are legit. Even if they aren't, that's okay, I've sold fake LV purses for $40. There is a market for everything. 
I scored big last month with Amiibos for the Wii U. 

If anyone has any questions or want to start your own thrift investment, just holla at me, I can walk you through what I know. Or, if anyone has similar tactics besides the shadier side of hustling, feel free to share. I'm sure we could all use a few bucks leverage in the game!

I'd like to think I have a pretty strong sense of will power, and that I could force myself out of addiction if I were to succumb to it, but I could be wrong.

I don't want to try shooting up just yet, but I think smoking some dope would be okay. Is smoking anywhere near as great as shooting up? Is it as addictive?

Yeah, the reason I think I'm weird compared to everyone else is everyone else gives into noddding. They just let it take them. Me? I struggle to keep my eyes open, I go splash eater on them, everything, because I believe if you fall asleep, you're basically wasting a buzz.

I also categorize opiate buzzes by where I feel them, which is kind of hard to explain. But, to me, a nodding buzz is a ""bad"" buzz, because the buzz is in my eyes and I can't stay awake. For me, an ideal buzz is one that I feel mostly around my forehead, concentrated mainly around my brow, if that makes any sense. If it's a forehead buzz, and it doesn't move any lower to my eyes to make me start nodding, then it's an ideal buzz.

Idk, I just like to be awake to experience my buzz, and I like to do stuff like watching TV or playing videogames while opiate stoned.

But I was told that these new ones have a different formula with some gel or some shit inside so this person told me you can't blow them (instant disappointment for my fiend of a nose).

My question is basically is that true?  I read some mad scientist shit about shaving them down, microwaving then freezing - does anyone know if that really works? Or anything else I could do to make this better (I have 3 more for tomorrow)?  I popped two and I feel it I guess but it's meh, slow and subtle.

But not a dickhead one that taxes people every time for $20 each time for months. I believe I am completely fair, and I think that i've helped some people quite a bit. I don't mean for this to be a ""bragging"" or ""self promotion"" or a ""hookup"" thread, not at all. Just maybe give some of y'all ideas on how to help yourself a little, help someone else, and everyone is happy. Even get some criticism/ideas from y'all!

Basically, people hit me up. Usually from the-subreddit-that-shall-not-be-named (pm me if you're interested ). I live in one of the worlds most premiere and visited tourist cities, so a lot of the time it's people from out of town visitng, but most of the time it's locals.

For those visiting and staying on the strip(and usually don't have a car), I basically say ""okay. yeah I have a good connect for X Y and Z drug. Do you have a car? No, okay then, you will have to buy $X amount in order for us to deliver. It's a long drive and my dealer wont do it for $40 worth. My car is broke right now, so basically he has to come get me then we have to meet up with you. Is it cool if you throw him like 5-10 bucks for gas? Okay cool. And for this connect, I charge 0.5g of black, which is about $40. After that, you get his number/meet him, wont have to go through me any more. Is that cool? Alright see you in an hour"".

For locals its similar. I tell them straight up I charge 0.5g, come scoop me, we meet up with the dealer, you get to meet him/his number(as long as he thinks you're cool, which everyone has been so far). Boom, done. Sometimes we become ""friends"", sometimes its literally just a one-and-done deal.

Do you guys think this is fair? Like I said, I only tax them about usually $40 worth of BTH and then they get the connect so they can go without have me middlemanning as often as they please.

Honestly, I think I should charge more, like $60 flat, and I can just spend that on what I want(prob some black and just some cash). The only problem is, a lot of the time, these people are only picking up like, a gram or whatever(which is fine! I get it. I don't pick up much when I cop anyway. I was just using it as a detail for my next sentence). So it's kinda hard to ask em for $60 when they only planned on buying $80 worth lol. 

These deals take an hour maybe 25% of the time, hour and 45 minutes about 50% of the time, the other times they can take 2 and a half hours, even 3 once in a long while. That's quite a bit of my time to help this person out(I know, I know, im not doing it for free...) and i'm also risking both my and my dealer(s) necks by doing this. I always do research(via reddit) of course of these people and if anything seems off then its a big fat ""No cant help ya sorry"". 

Also, how much should I be asking from the dealers for all the business i'm giving them? They aren't some hardcore thugs or anything, they're more like a friend/uncle type figure most of the time so.

Any other middlemen here? How do y'all go about your business? Any tips for me? Any criticisms? Go at it!

Thanks guys.

I've been in a battle with 4 mental health disorders (BPD/Bipolar/Depression/Anx) since I was very young which was made worse by severe bulllying for years in my early teens. I'm 27 now.

Because of mainly this, I've grew up absolutely hating myself and have a void inside of me which has only filled up for part of my day when using opiates.

I started using 2 years ago after one of my new housemates (university) was a dealer from southern Italy. Before that I'd tried pretty much every drug but an opiate, but was always on the lookout for em. I have explored all legit ways of getting myself well with my psych/therapist including being on lithium but nothing has ever come close to working and I would say a few years back I 99.99% gave up on myself and have been on the path to self-destruction ever since.

So I started smoking (H3) which I didn't like much, so very quickly I started sniffing H4 and oxycontin OCs and have been ever since except for 1 week ago when I could no longer afford expensive H4 and pills. So I had to switch to the inexpensive way which is to inject H3.

Fuck man. I didn't know it was so hard to inject yourself properly, esp since my dominant hand has bad nerve trouble atm (temporary). I'd done so much research prior on correct technique and vein maps etc etc so I thought it'd be easy esp since I'm thin and can see quite a few veins. I was going into w/ds by the time id got my H3 last week so I was desperately scrambling to cook it and shoot up. With as much patience as I could manage, I tried to find a vein. For the life of me I could not draw blood on any visible vein I tried to hit so I just so I plugged in desparation to get through. Plugging H3 is way worse than sniffing H4 imo. Anyway its taken me 7 fucking days of careful trying to find an excellent vein; that was 2 hours ago .....................................

HOLY SHIIIIIIT!

That feeling.

Aaaaahhhhhh.

That rush.

I can';t believe I snorted for 2 years.

Got a little taste of heaven and it came at a good time as I  had wrriten a suicide note and had plans to off myself tomorrow.

Now I'm thinking if I can control (chipping) mainlining like I did with snorting, I'm golden.

Anyone else?,"Since trying to become opiate free over the past 6 months, with lots of ups and downs, I've noticed a common occurrence that seems to make me more susceptible to relapse. 

Whenever I'm not using, I'm typically very quiet, depressed, disinterested, and altogether just a weird person. This often leads to comments from friends and family about me possibly using again and sometimes outright accusations that I don't seem 'normal' and I must be high because I'm anti-social and 'out of it'.

This is extremely frustrating because I so desperately yearn to feel 'normal' again. The way I used to feel before I developed a habit. Sociable, happy, funny, etc. But I simply have not been able to reclaim this mental state since I started using many years ago because the most amount of consecutive clean time I've had is only about 45 days.

Conversely, when I finally cave in and use again, I have energy and become much more talkative. This often leads to friend and family commenting at I'm starting seem like my old self again and that I look like I'm doing better (with regard to staying clean).

Does anyone else experience the same treatment from their friends and family?

3ne1wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3ne1wj/cant_get_high_help/,36,https://redd.it/3ne1wj,xmropiex,Can't get high... help. :(,"Hey all, long time lurker, first post here (and a long one, sorry) (throwaway acct too, btw). So, here's a quick history first:

Long term opiate user, 15+ years. Was on subs for 2.5 years until ~45 days ago. Used Kratom for ~30 days to get subs out of my system and procure opiates. Then, I started a real opiate binge about 2 weeks ago.

So far, I've been through 2.5+g of #4, 20 Oxy 30mg Blues, 20 Vicodin, and 1.25g of BTH. So far, the only thing that got me even remotely high was the 1.25g of BTH (smoked 1g in a day).

I assume that subs ruined my receptors. The binge before the subs (and after a 1.5 year methadone treatment) was beautiful, 1 Norco 10 got me blitzed for a few weeks, then topped out at 3 then switched to blues and sniffing half would put me in a crazy nod. So, WTF??

Anyways, recently, everything other than the BTH at least registered to some degree (meaning I felt it - not a high - but something happened), but now these two different kinds of #4 I have are doing NOTHING except keeping me out of WDs.

I have seriously snorted .25g of #4 within a few hours today and received no effect. I can't bang right now for several reasons. I'm considering plugging now, but I don't know if it's worth it.

Anyways, wtf do I do? I know these bags of #4 are legit because they get me well off of just a bump or two. I can't believe there is that much of a gap between the threshold of stopping WDs and feeling something. And, eating half an Oxy 30 was, at least, registering and getting me a mild, mild, buzz - no real euphoria, but a feel good feeling, some itch and a little warmth. So, I know my tolerance isn't THAT high. 

I can't understand what's going on here. I don't want to plug because I feel like maybe (in some amazingly impossible coincidence) both of these types of #4 were made in a way that gives them a horrible BA when sniffed... they need to be shot or plugged, maybe? But, I'm near the end of both bags and don't want to just shove it all up my butt and die or do too little and waste it. 

Is this even possible? Or am I just doomed to never feel opiates again - even though I did feel them recently? Maybe I blew my tolerance up even more with that day of BTH?

HELP, I will have more tar in 3-4 days to end out my failed binge with something resembling a good time (going back on subs). I just want to feel one tiny little buzz before going back on Kratom to wait for the BTH. 

But, really, the point of this post is to find out if I'm totally insane. Or maybe this is really the hell that a former Subutex-treated 15+ year opiate abuser lives in? Like, I just can't even do my favorite thing in the world now? :( 


**TL;DR: I can't seem to get high. Done way too many opiates and not feeling shit except from smoking 1g of BTH in a day. Stuck without BTH for a few days and have 2 kinds of #4 that are not working when sniffed. Is this really my life or do I need to just snort .5 of #4 all at once? WTF?**

Still deal thing with a plethora of family issues. These are just random thoughts after I took acid when I got off work yesterday after my 8 hour shift in the factory. I dropped at 12 am Friday night/this morning.  now I'm shopping with family for fucks sake. But anyway here is it is. I haven't even read it yet just typed it up in iPhone notes and pasted below.


I'm reaching that age now. The age where people are deciding on the direction they are gonna head in life and working towards it. And I have so many things I want to do but no means to accomplish them. 



Another day where shooting dope would push away the problems. The regrets. The memories. A quick fix for a temporary problem. A black hole that just feeds off negative energy. And the more you feed it the bigger and harder to pull away from it becomes. 



It would be so easy just to go pull a little money out of my savings. The account my family put their hard earned dollars into. The account they set up when I was born and they knew I would conquer the world. 



Some days I still feel like that's a possibility. But today is not one of those days. That feeling is far removed. The barriers are real and the windows of opportunity are closing faster and after each shot. 


I gotta get it together. I fear for my life that if I don't, there will be nothing left. No one can take away my mind from me except myself. And I'm slowly scooping ice cream hunks out day by day. We are creatures of habit. Change is fucking hard. To fight what we have ingrained in our minds thru repetition. 



On the other side it is possible. The existence of our reality as we perceive it would not be if it were not. The strong push through and do what they need to survive. They adapt and grow with the ever changing climate.

At least this has been my experience thus far.


At 11 years old my mom got sick. I was told she was in the hospital because even though I've always been pretty smart my mind was still too young to fully grasp that she was having a mental breakdown. Years later I would come to find out it was a mental hospital. My little brother and sister along with my mom moved from Virginia back in with family in Alabama while my dad stayed and worked in D.C.


I worked in my uncles chicken houses for the summer between 5th and 6th grade. This would mark the beginning of my downward spiral. 


Finally In November My dad joined us and we moved to the suburbs once again south of Atlanta, Georgia. At 13 years old I first started cutting. At 14 I started burning myself. I didn't know why at the time I just felt that it helped. I realize now that out of all the pain I was feeling, harming myself was the only thing I could control. 


In 8th grade I smoked pot and drank for the first time. Marijuana was a godsend. No longer did I have to deal with all the pain and hurt, I could just numb it and push it away. I used that maybe 5 times between 14-15. Then after a harsh break up I began to smoke everyday. 


Numb the pain. Block it out


I went to my first psych ward at 16 years old for suicidal ideation. I was on some neurological medication for headaches prescribed by some Chinese fuckwit that was know to cause suicidal thoughts in teens and young adults.


From the age of sixteen I would go on try all of the classic psychedelics, downers, uppers, dissociatives and a myriad of research chemicals. I was placed in rehab for pot at the young age of 16. See my parents were from a small little town in Alabama. My mother had never even seen pot before. So I was placed with kids much worse of than I was. 15 year olds addicted to shooting dilaudid, smoking crystal meth and everything between.


Numb the pain. Block it out


I got out and continued smoking. At the age of 17 two weeks after my birthday I was thrown in big boy jail for going into unlocked cars in my yuppie fuck school parking lot while on ten milligrams of klonopin. I had three counts of felony entering auto. I didn't talk to my parents for a week. I was terrified to say the least. After no contact I finally talk to my father after hearing my name called for visitation. I sat in jail till Christmas until I was placed in another rehab/juvenile boot camp In Alabama for 45 days.

After getting out I stayed ""clean"" for maybe three months before I broke into the same gas station 4 times. They don't teach you not to hit the same lick more than once in any textbook I've ever read. At this point I'm doing online schooling. The cops show up at 1pm with a warrant for my arrest.

I go to college and stay in class for two weeks before I'm getting high and drinking everyday. I meet contacts for everything and start doing the same shit again. The pain subsides. But only for a little awhile before I am arrested again. Thank god for bumfuck nowhere towns in Alabama. I knew I would bond out when they pull out paper to fingerprint and the cells have actual bars on them. No computers no criminal history pops up. I bond out the next morning with a court date and my first misdemeanor charges for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. To most people this would be a wake up call. But not me. I continue doing the same thing until I meet this girl.

I turn myself in and get down on my knees and beg. She tells me I must stay wth family. No drug test no reprimands, sanctions, jail time, or anything. She takes one look at my crying mother and can't do it. This is now my sixth P.O.

And until I work through my issues and forgive myself for all the people I have conned, robbed, stolen from, lied to and fucked over I will never stop using. It will continue to eat me alive until I either end up in prison, OD, or blow my fucking brains out.

I know what I must do to repair the damage I have done. Am I strong enough to do it?


Embrace the pain. Work through it.

I saw what I remembered

The young,

junkies.



I was young,

only 19 at the time,

the junkies,

the addicted

the old

than the young,

lively,

bright and hopeful.



I think the main thing,

the gap

between people my own age

and the closeness

with the junkies,

was the difference in hope,

or maybe the difference in

each group's

understanding of reality.



Not that I was homeless,

or had ever been anywhere near it,

or that I was addicted to the point

that I was out of control,

but the junkies all had something definitive
that ruled their lives,

one singular purpose,

while many of the people my age simply

flowed through life,

seeking out a family,

the big house,

the white pickett fence

in search of meaning.



I guess,

at the core of it,

I was better able to 

understand a life devoted

to heroin

to the abstract

unobtainable.

I mean truly homeless, not some 19 year old addict that got kicked out by mommy and daddy but mommy is still paying his phone bill and car insurance, he still sneaks into his house for stuff to pawn, etc.

I mean either in and out of homeless shelters, or living under a bridge or a ""homeless colony"", stuff like that.

I'm mostly referring to homeless Heroin addicts, but I guess anyone really applies...theres quite a few things that you need in order to shoot heroin. A needle, cooker(lighter if its BTH), a cotton, a wrap-tie-off thing(forgot what its called, i'm an idiot. Like a belt or shoe string or whatever).

Now clearly, they get these things and use them til they absolutely can not any more. They don't have money to spend on new needles, clean cottons, etc. Maybe they get to shoot up in a bathroom once in a while, but I bet most of the time its under a bridge or in an alley.

So, if anyone wouldn't mind answering these questions

1. How did you aquire your drug(s), what did you use, and how did you use it? If shooting up, how did you get the stuff you needed to shoot up, and how did you keep it ""clean""
Wh
2. How did you afford your addiction? How much did you use, and how often?

3. How often were you in withdrawl?

4, If you were in a shelter, was there any open help for addicts?

5. Are you homeless now? If so, what kind of conditions? If not, how did you become not homeless any more? Are you still an addict?

I can never seem to stay away for too long, months and years go by and eventually I get that urge to use again.

I got the urge late last month and found nothing but frustration.  $6 for a Vicodin, $1 a mg for oxycodone, $2 an mg for oxymorphone.  I bitched and complained and refused to pay those prices (they're really high compared to what I was used to).  The prices kept going up and up.  I scored some 30mg roxis for $15 a pop only to have the guy jack them up to $25 when I came around a few days later.  I had given up hope.

Then out of nowhere a man with H appeared.  I tried a bump, only my second time with this lovely stuff (lack of access).  It felt just like morphine...I am in love.

Last night I sent a txt, within an hour I had a $50 bag in my hands and a bump in my nose.  I chilled with the dude for two hours and we got a long well.  He's hooking me up with a job and we've made plans to chill this week.  We instantly got a long...it was strange and it wasn't the dope.  Our pasts are so similar (farm boys) and our way of thinking is pretty much the same.  We discussed politics over 20mg of oxymorphone and bowls of the finest kush.

No I sit here knowing that I'm facing down the path of addiction again.  I had half the bag left over this morning after an all night nod session.  I held out for three hours until my nose started to run.  The sickness is already creeping back in to my life, I had a bump to straighten myself out.  I know I'm going back over there tomorrow or the next day to spend another $50 or more.

The Holidays are coming up too...funny how almost every time I've come back to the life it is right around the Holidays.  I'm sure my depression about where I am in life and my family coming in to remind me what a loser I am has something to do with that.

I'm coming to terms with the fact that I can't ever quit this shit.  It's like a demon that lives inside of me.  I'm sure within a few months I'll be signing up for the clinic and lining up for my daily dose of 'done.  I don't really see another way...

I wanted to kind of laugh that he was more worried about the FBI knocking down his door than fuckers ODing. Him and his girl are arguing about it now. She's agreed with me this whole time.

3npiop,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3npiop/help_needed/,16,https://redd.it/3npiop,Beeswax666,Help needed...,Hi. I'm in a suboxone program and my doctor is pretty much my primary care doctor as well. I've been having symptoms similar to hyperthyroidism and he's ordered some blood tests for me to get. I haven't gone to take the test yet because I am afraid he could have thrown a drug test in the referral as well. Can he do that without telling me? The reason I'm a little apprehensive is because I took a couple Xanax last night and I'm not prescribed that. A symptom of hyperthyroidism is high anxiety so sometimes I need it to keep from flipping out. I would hate to have this test done only to have my doctor kick me out of the program for failing for drugs I'm not prescribed. Advice?,1444140545.0

How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us? Robbing us of life and light. Mockin' us with the sight of what we might've known. Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed through this night?"" *- The Thin Red Line*

This persecution is too great. We live on the fringe. We live outside society and none of their help ever comes. We are nations, are we not? Our leaders love and provide for us, do they not? That's their job, is it not? But we are left alone. We're non-citizens in their eyes. We belong to no-one and so it's justified to let them kill us, through harm, confinement or neglect. They condemn us to a battery of hardships on top of our own. We cannot keep living like this. Suffering from day to day with the only end being an 8 x 4 box in the ground.

Are we not human? Are we the subhuman dwellers leeching off society? No, we're not. We contribute as much as anyone else but our disease, this all encompassing disease of the inability to condemn ourselves to sobriety kicks us back down to the floor. We're mud because of a difference in brain chemistry, a difference in socio-economic background, a shitty little difference that should never matter. We cannot get help, we cannot save ourselves so we're left to rot. Rot until our final resting place.

A few days ago my friend overdosed and died. I knew her well. We colluded in a heroin habit that I eventually freed myself from. She did not. In her wake she left her child, a tender age of 12. How do our leaders forget about that. They treat the ones who've chosen a separate path like dirt but neglect to think of the impact around them.

Sure, you can say it was her fault; she went too far, she didn't know her limit, she was irresponsible. Then why condemn an innocent child? Condemn them to foster homes, push them into child prisons with a never ending cycle of de facto homes and social upheaval. 

Heroin ruins everything. It takes away your light and life. It takes everything. We know it, they know it and society knows it but is it really our fault? Are we to blame? Are the conditions we live in not applicable when it comes to ""just another overdose""? Will no-one take responsibility? It's not the sole burden of us, the lifestyle we live is not chosen, it's a mistake that turns into a death sentence and we're supposed to be persecuted based on a mistake we made 10 or 20 years ago. 

I don't know what I hate more; this drug or the society that gives us no help. 

It's a never ending cycle of score, take the medicine and find money to score. It doesn't need to be like this and there certainly doesn't need to be a death sentence cast upon the sufferers of this disease. It's an epidemic. We need to start treating it as that, instead of forcing us live behind the walls of society. 

We are the modern leper. So where are our bells?",1444122458.0

I might cross-post this to opiates (which I've obviously done...) since this is definitely in their wheelhouse, but drugs is a much bigger sub and I figure I can get an answer more quickly.

Oh yeah, and one more question. On a somewhat related note, would Wellbutrin, an NDRI, decrease the high/euphoria I'd get from the drug (and all opiates for that matter).

If you're in the 412 and run into some bags with the red stamp ""Best Day Ever,"" use with caution. I'm not saying they're killer bags, and quite honestly not even sure it was fent-cut (they might just be some fire ass dope), just that they're stronger than usual. 

I'm usually a 4-5 bag-at-a-time shooter and on three I felt like I was going to fall out. I may have if I hadn't been walking a trail immediately after it. Ears were ringing and vision was very blurry. However, that isn't to say it didn't feel good and didn't settle into an amazing high. Just be safe, friends!

Sick as fuck. Haven't had any dope since two nights ago. I can get points for $25 and a half g for $100. Well I had $5 to my name. Well, my good buddy came over to hang out after he got off work. We play cards now which we just randomly started doing a few weeks ago. So him, my brother, and I are playing black jack. Well I quickly had turned my $5 into $50. So I'm fucking pumped because I had no chance of getting anything and now I have enough for two points. I go to walk away because my brother was out of money and I was happy with my winnings. Then my buddy asks me if I want to play one last hand and put $50 on it. I already had enough to not only fix my sickness but get me high as well so I really didn't want to do it but everyone around me peer pressured me into it. So he hands me my first card face down and it was an ace (aces can be high or low). Then my face up card was an ace. So I hit and get an 8. I hit again and get a king. I say ""fuuuuck me"" and everyone starts laughing at me thinking I busted. So he said ""I'm gonna stay ole bud"". Well we flip our cards over and he had a 13. Since he thought I had busted he didn't expect me to have another ace. He was already grabbing the money then I flipped mine and had 20. Then everyone went wild and he said ""you scheming son of a bitch"". I get my dude on the horn and tell him to bring me a half. 30 minutes later I'm getting high as fuck and enjoying myself. So needless to say I'm happy as can be right now. Turned $5 and being dope sick with no hope of fixing it to having $100 and buying a half...

3nnmbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3nnmbi/michael_fucking_jordan/,24,https://redd.it/3nnmbi,morbo2000,Michael FUCKING Jordan,"Basketball.  

Five men try and get a ball into a cylinder ten feet above the ground.  This is a Mayan blood sport handed down to us from forgotten gods.  Humans work together to jostle, smash and shove their way to the hoop as the opposition tries to incapacitate the holder of the ball.  But like any violent conflict, amazing dramas are played out.  

Since dating Kym, I have watched A LOT of basketball.  The Warriors are her team but Michael Jordan is her hero.  To listen to Kym talk about him you would think he is a god that can walk on air.  And she loudly asserts this during The Game.  

""Damn Payton!  Jordan lit you up like you're standing still son!"" taunts the obnoxious girl with braided green hair tied in tight knots against her scalp.  ""Fucking peanut-headed motherfucker!""

""Hey Payton's from Oakland"" chides Melo.  

Melo loves basketball too.  Kym, Autumn and Melo all used to play basketball in high school.  This game rekindles the aggressive, competitive jock within them.  They actually care who wins.

""East bay!"" says Kym grabbing the bong.  She takes a massive rip and hands it to Autumn.  ""Oaktown represent!  But you're still going down!""

""How was that not an offensive foul?"" complains Autumn cracking her gum.

""Haha!"" mocks Kym at the replay which clearly shows Autumn is right but the referees do nothing.  

Autumn stares at Kym through narrow, irked eyes.  She's not used to crazy, coked-out, cartoon-flavored Kym.  This is an acquired taste.  

""Wow that's gonna be a long plane ride home for the LOSERS"" smirks Kym as she lights a cigarette.  

""Kym I love your nails"" smiles Autumn sweetly as she snaps her gum.  ""My grandma likes that color too.""

Kym's fingernails and toenails are Chicago Bulls blood red.  Not her usual choice.  Last night when she trailed her hand down my chest I grew fixated on her nails.  They looked so normal sexy.  Like the Playboy magazine women I saw as a kid.  

""Aww thanks"" says Kym suddenly lunging her head at Autumn and stopping an inch away from her face.  Autumns stares back amused.  ""And I love that flannel Autumn.  Hey!  Do they make those for girls?"" 

""Heh heh"" chuckles Dev who has been watching Kym and Autumn instead of the game.

""Well I gotta take a shit"" announces Jason.

Jason's indifferent to the game and brewing animosity between Autumn and Kym.  He grabs one of Kym's Cosmopolitan magazines off the table.

""Anyone gotta pee?  Trust me...""

Game 6 of the 1996 NBA Finals.  Chicago Bulls vs Seattle SuperSonics.  Earlier we were at the park watching the Beastie Boy's Free Tibet concert.  Kym and Melo insisted leaving after the Red Hot Chili Peppers for The Game.  A lot of beer is going down with bumps of coke.  Kym and I ate some oxy because we ran out of H this morning.  Kym's pretending it's no big deal but I know she can feel it.  I feel it.  That vortex in my center.  The blackhole sucking in the dragon's desire.  So we eat oxy, do bumps and drink.  

Dev and Melo met us at the park during Beck.  Kym had a thermos of coffee.  Dev showed up with hardboiled eggs and I bought a thumbnail of hash from a hippie named Detour.  We ate eggs, sipped coffee and zoned out on the 100,000 people wandering our park.  Then Autumn appeared.  

""Saw your stripes"" she said squeezing my arm.  

Kym dyed my hair black with thick, red streaks.  I felt her winding up so I whispered: Jason.  Obviously this is a Jason thing.  Autumn has a bag of croissants from Jason's bakery.  She hands them out but Kym refuses.  Just stares at Autumn who ignores her.  Great.  I smoke hash with Melo and ignore them both.    

Jason starts his shift at 2am.  He works alone and often has friends drop by.  That was me before Kym.  Now his bakery friend is Autumn.  Hanging with Jason while he mixes dough is a drugfest of coke, espresso shots, weed and punk music tapes blasted from a staticky boombox.  No one cares as long as he fills the orders and the first racks are ready by 5am.  

Autumn sits on the couch next to Kym in her black tights, boots, flannel and ugly hat that looks like a crumpled, brown paper bag made of cloth.  Autumn is from Seattle and trash talking with Kym while cracking her gum.  She keeps sucking gum through her teeth making three or four rapid-fire pops.  After an hour of this, I wish she would just smoke cigarettes like the rest of us.

""Oh fuck Jordan!"" groans Autumn as she cracks another string of bubbles.  ""And Pippen?  Horse faced has-been!  Sonics dominated the last two games.  They got momentum.""

""True"" agrees Melo.  ""Last two games were all Sonics.""

""Payton and Kemp are on fire!  This is going 7 games"" assures Autumn as we watch highlights from the series backed by NBC's insane, heavy metal music.

""Bitch please"" scoffs Kym.  Autumn whips around annoyed but Kym keeps going.  ""Jordan's DUE.  This ends tonight.  He's Michael FUCKING Jordan!  Game over!""

""Kemp and Payton-""

""Kemp sucks donkey dick-""

""Hey!"" scolds Melo.  ""Easy.  I can't hear the game.""

Autumn and Kym both glare at Melo for a second, harrumph and lean back into the couch in unison just as Jason comes back from the bathroom rubbing his gut.  He plops back on the couch and lets out a huge bear yawn.  As he stretches, Autumn wraps her arms around his neck, snuggles into his chest, looks up and kisses him.  

Well this is a new thing.  These two have definitely gotten together but the public displays just started.  Kym rolls her eyes.  Dev is no longer paying attention and reading something called Grimoire of Honorius.  Melo stares intently at the TV and shouts at some injustice.  Jason looks happy.  His hand slides down Autumn's back to her hip.  Then he notices Kym.  

""Jesus!  You look like a Baseball Fury.""

""Yeah got a bat?"" smirks Kym.

""Baseball Furies are silent"" chirps Dev from behind her book.

""Oh fuck off Devika!"" grins Kym snatching my cigarette a moment before it touches my lips. 

Kym's wearing her red, Michael Jordan jersey.  The iconic #23 mixes curiously with black eyeliner smeared across her eyes.  It looks artsy vicious with the spiked collar around her throat, silver bracelets and green hair.  Kym says Dennis Rodman inspired her look.  Rodman's the guy on the Bulls with rainbow hair.  He's known for being obnoxious and getting under people's skin...yeah.  

Kym jumps up to yell and I watch her bend over in her tiny, ripped jean shorts.  A Misfit patch sewn on her ass stares back at me.  Then she jumps up and down screaming at the referee.  Her clompy, black boots shake the whole house.

""Oh my god he so FUCKING flopped!"" she complains.  
  
Cocaine, beer and Kym is loud.  I sigh, light another cigarette and look around.  Only Dev is interesting.  She wears Kym's old black cocktail dress.  On Kym it was short and revealing but on Dev it's a full length black gown that makes her look elegant and grim.  She sits crosslegged in front of three lit candles that surround a jar.  Dangling in the jar is a piece of string tied to a shell.  She senses me and she looks up.  

""What's that?"" I ask.

""I'm trying to catch ghosts.""

I fake smile and look away.  Yeah that's normal.  On TV, a man named Marv Albert paints a dramatic conflict.  His voice and delivery is infectious.  No wonder my friends sit on the edge of their seats screaming like insane people.  

""Dude"" interrupts Jason.

I look at him.  Flour spots cover his Holiday in Cambodia t-shirt.  Jase's raccoon eyes are bloodshot from a long night.  I can smell baked bread and cinnamon as he leans over Autumn to speak.    

""The power bill is off"" he says.

I feel one of my eyebrows rising and stop it before Kym notices.  Roommate code.  Come with me and get high.

""Show me"" I say getting up.

In Jason's room we can hear the game heating up.  Autumn shrieks victoriously while Kym and Melo groan.  Someone throws something violently against the wall.

""Fucking Kym"" says Jason shaking his head.  He pours cocaine into the ceramic mortar and pestle I swiped from lab.  He looks at me.

""Oxy?""

""Yeah"" I say fishing some out of my pocket.  Jason crushes them in the bowl.  

""From Autumn"" says Jason holding up a dime bag of crumbly, beige powder.  He hands me my bag and I feel JOY.  The Game, the free concert, my life with my friends are all good things but man...I have been dying for this fucking bag.  The weight is pleasing.  Even with Kym, it's two and half days of the perfect life.  

""Powder?"" I ask.  

""Seattle China.  It's serious"" says Jason adding some to the bowl.  He grinds it in.  ""So just a little.  For reals dude.  Warn Kym.  This stuff puts me on my ass.""

Jase chops out six lines on his Bark at the Moon CD.  The mix of coke, smack and oxy make it look like dirty coke.  We rail three lines each...and my brain is stabbed with icicles as demons grab my body and chain it to the floor.  My ghost HEAVES and I swoon with the tilting room.  I catch myself before I fall over.  Holy shit Jase was right.  The nod approaches...then the coke marches in.  Mixed with oxy it would have been enough but enter the dragon.  And the dragon ROARS.  My limbs are weighed down by surreal gravity as I slow motion walk back to the couch.  Something happened on TV and Kym is doing a crazy dance.  She leaps over the coffee table and high fives Melo who is pumping his fist and yelling like a madman. 

""You see that shit?!  Rodman with a no look to Michael FUCKING Jordan!"" yells Kym.

I make my way to the couch and Kym stops shouting and looks at me.  She instantly perceives I'm wrecked and makes me high five her.  I feel like a fat little kid getting picked on in PE again.  Jason lies at Autumn's feet like a dog.  His bloodshot eyes are glistening slits gazing vacantly at the TV.  Autumn stonily stares at the game with her arms crossed across her flannel.  Her team is losing in the other team's arena.  The crowd screams for blood.   

""Oh hey babe"" says Kym chugging her beer and belching loudly in my ear.  ""You figure out the-"", and she suddenly slams her elbow into my ribs.  ""-bills?""

If I hadn't anesthetized myself that would have hurt.  After a slight delay, I gasp.  Ow.  

""Ok, ok"" I say sliding her the bag.  ""Just a bump.  Tiny one Kym.  It's heavy.  Ok?"" I say looking into sea blue eyes.

""Hmm"" she says weighing my words and scrutinizing my moronic stupor.  She hands the bag back.  ""Then later babe.  I don't wanna miss The Game.""

Wow.  Basketball is powerful.  I can't think of anything I'd rather do than heroin.  Little moments of self-control like this are like rays of sunshine.  If Kym can do it for basketball, I can do it for something...right?

And the Bulls just start to beat the hell out of the Sonics.  Autumn watches in disbelief as her home team unravels.  The end is nigh.  And Kym is a gracious victor.

""Yeah!  Told you girl!"" she points at Autumn while doing a booty dance across the room.  ""But good game.  Do you know what happened Autumn?  Let me explain.  Michael FUCKING Jordan happened!""  

Melo lights a finger fat joint of green bud as the media interviews Michael FUCKING Jordan.  We pass it around and the intensity of our past sins spark up again.  Six beers becomes seven, the cocaine stops numbing our highs and the world crushes in.  Fuck I am starving.

""Let's go eat"" I hear myself say softly.  Man I am high.  My meat is on autopilot and it needs food to continue.  Sadly I know if I push the ball forward, gravity will deliver it and I can meekly grab onto Kym and enjoy the ride.

""Hear hear!"" agrees Dev slamming her book shut and blowing out the candles.  ""It's Sunday.  $6.50 buffet at Sues.""

""Oh hell yeah"" agrees Kym.  

I love Sues.  An Indian restaurant within walking distance.  Sue treats us like royalty though we stumble in drunk and high like crazed beasts.  Great service.  Within seconds of sitting a basket of fresh naan bread appears with a galaxy of yogurts, chutneys and sauces.  Water and coffee cups for Sue's amazing amphetamine tea.  After gorging yourself on Indian buffet you slip into the Indian food coma.  A dreamy, masala bliss.  You could sit there forever...but Sue runs a restaurant.  So the chai tea she serves is an upper.  I have no idea what's in it but it wakes you the fuck up and you can stumble home, back to school or work.  All for $6.50 plus tip.
          
""Wait what?"" yawns Autumn.  Even her yawns ends with a Pop! Crack! of gum.  ""I like Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Indian food.  Like fry bread or jerky.  But I don't like that dot-head, curry Thank you very much! - Indian food.""

Melo laughs.  Dev looks peeved.  Kym stares at Autumn like dried human shit on the sidewalk.  I grin and look at Jason who is unfazed.  How can Jason let that go?  I'll tell you how.  That pug nosed girl fucks him.  A lot is forgiven when someone touches your penis.

""Jason let's get American food ok?"" whines Autumn.  ""Like the diner.""

Jason nods serenely.  ""Yeah ok.  You hungry now?""

""Yes.  I'm gonna use the bathroom and we can go"" smiles Autumn.

She disappears down the hall.

""We'll catch up with you guys later"" yawns Jason.  ""Where are you going tonight?""

""Maybe Slims?  Some of the bands from the Free Tibet thing will be playing.""

As we debate where to go, I give Melo hash and coke and he rolls another joint and sticks it in Kym's bong.  We smoke and talk as Kym puts on her Rancid tape.  Then she goes into our bedroom to look at her face which is already perfect but she's a girl.  I know from the bedroom, she will go into the bathroom for the better light and check one last time in the hall mirror.  At every place we visit with a mirror you will find Kym in front of it.  I don't get it but I certainly don't mess with it.  

After awhile Jason yawns.  I'm so hungry I can smell korma and vindaloo in my empty skull.  Dev makes Melo go check on Autumn because she wants to pee before we go.  I hear him knocking on the bathroom door.  Then he comes back.

""Jase.  That girl nodded out on the can.""

We all look.  Awkward.  Autumn is slumped over the toilet with her tights around her ankles, head in her lap and both arms dangle to the floor.  Looks like she fixed up, cleaned up, sat for a piss and lights out.  

""Let's shave off one of her eyebrows"" smiles Kym maliciously.

""One?"" asks Melo.

""Yeah so she has to shave the other one herself.""

""Man that's fucked up"" says Melo shaking his head.

""I know right?"" giggles Kym.

Jason and Dev get her off the toilet.  She woke up for a second and seemed lucid as Dev yanked up her tights.

""I what?""

""You nodded on the toilet"" says Dev.

""Oh.  Ok."" 

And she was out again.  Jason dumped her on his bed.  I rolled her on her side and Kym steals a piece of gum from her purse.

""Ok Indian"" says Jason looking around.

We nod and grab our coats and file out the door.  Though summer is technically here, the nights are still freezing when the bay breeze slips in.  Indian food is perfect.  Heavy, filling and dreamy.   

""I don't like that girl"" says Kym popping in the gum and gnashing it.

I bought a bundle down the way yesterday. Stuff seems very strong, it is pretty much white with maybe a slight beige tint, but here is where it gets weird.

1) I've done cocaine before, I know coke has the numbing agent that it is usually cut with. 
2) I hadn't noticed this in the first 4 bags, but the last bag I just snorted kind of numbed my nose. I got some stuff in the back of my throat, cleared it out, spit it out....Now my front 2 teeth are numb. It definitely is an opiate as it got me high (though it is a more sedating high than other stuff i've been getting)

Has anyone on the E.C ever gotten stuff that was cut with lidocaine or something that numbed them? It is scaring the shit out of me, it has been 30 mins and i noticed it went away a little bit, but very strange. I hate when

 But when I combine them both oohhhh god, I've never experienced true opiate rush, but that's the closest thing I can imagine. If I smoke a cigarette (preferably without a true filter) while I am high on PST and benzos, I get this tingly feeling on all my body and I literally forget to breathe for some time, I feel like I'm melting in a warm blanket. I sweat a lot and get very nauseous, but It's very pleasurable. It's a really strong sensation, and I feel like I'm passing out at every moment, and can't keep my eyes open, so I have to not smoke too fast otherwise it's too much overwhelming.

In a haze coming off of smoking 20 roxies the night before, wishing I had just ONE left to bring me out of my sickness. It was the ultimate Catch-22. I felt like such a piece of shit that I couldn't do anything but think about scoring so I could study for my finals. My mind was racing, I knew I was going to fail my classes and time was running out. I wasn't going to go without a fight. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't focus on my textbook. I knew that if I had some medicine in me I would be able to get some work done. I put all of my energy into finding some, and after many hours of laying in bed, staring at the clock, shaking and sweating, I got a phone call and knew relief was coming shortly. It was about time because it felt like a million scarabs were crawling under my skin, pushing against the walls and trying to escape like a bunch of trapped prisoners.

I was too sick to get out of my bed so I had my medicine delivered straight to my room. I crawled out of bed and barely made it to the door. There it was, one little blue pill smaller than a penny, a pill with all the power in the world over me, a pill stronger than anyone and everyone. The mere thought of what was about to happen put some life back into my legs. I carefully stood up and frantically searched for the first piece of foil I could find and a tooter. I was about to be back in my world, the world I loved and was so comfortable in, the world that was quickly crumbling right before my eyes. But at that moment I didn't care. If my world was going down I was going down with it. I took a flame to the perfectly straightened foil and my eyes zoned in on the beautiful pill, sliding down the foil like a teardrop rolling down a cheek. This was my ritual and I loved it as much as getting high itself. I inhaled the dense, blissful smoke of the first hit into my tired lungs and immediately felt as if a thousand pounds were lifted off of my shoulders. Suddenly everything in the world was right again. The pain was gone. Things weren't as bad as they seemed. All my problems seemed to fade under a cover of that thick smoke. ""This is the life"" I thought to myself. With every hit I felt like a part of me was coming back, until I was whole again. Life felt so simple, but deep down I knew I was only fooling myself. I was extremely depressed, but so what, I had what I needed at the moment and I felt okay with myself. Now was not the time to think about my problems, ""I'll deal with those some other time.""

I looked down at the foil and all I saw was a black spot. I tried to scrape one last hit but didn't get much. I finally felt decent enough to study, so I took out my textbook. Finally, now I can study like my life depends on it. I was so determined to pass this class and show my teacher that he was wrong. I read one word and thats when I realized how foolish I was. There was NO WAY in hell I was going to study. Now that I felt pretty good, all I wanted to do was enjoy my high. My mind was already on getting my next fix, so it's not like I could study even if I wanted to. I felt like such a dick because I told myself I was going to study after I got high, but I didn't care, I was too busy feeling good. I was so overwhelmed and torn that I broke down in tears. I didn't want this anymore, but I didn't know how to get out of it. I put myself in this trap, and I didn't even realize it. No one was answering my phone calls. My meds were wearing off and I knew it would be a long, cold, and sad night ahead. I wrapped myself in my blankets, just staring at the ceiling, trying my hardest to fall asleep. Sleep was my light at the end of the tunnel.""What a lucky guy I am"" I sarcastically thought to myself. All I had to look forward to was same pathetic miserable routine the next day. This was not the life I wanted to live, being miserable day after day, living for the short and ever fleeting moments of relief that my pills would bring me.",1444090093.0

Nick: ""I feel strange."" 

Mom: ""We're spinning off the planet. We don't know where we're going.""

Nick: ""That's the thing, I never knew where I was going. It's like I've been living this for a long time, and now everyone is catching up with me. It's strange.""


I've been feeling this way about any kind of apocalypse like event happening on this planet. I've been wishing it would happen so I could live my life like I do now. Living day to day, waking up and the only thing on my mind is surviving. Whether that be getting right or killing zombies to get to wherever I'm going. Being able to take what I need from whatever or whoever I need to take it from. Raiding pharmacies and other big ass stores to get my fix or anything else I need to survive. Not having to rely on shitty drug dealers and just making my way for myself. 

This subject has been talked about in other shows where people say ""the apocalypse is the best thing that ever happened to me"". I would be saying the same damn thing whether it be a zombie plague, alien invasion, or just a giant financial collapse that results in the collapse of society and the government. I don't care what causes it, I just know I will be super happy if any kind of apocalypse happens. No more bullshit work life that I could never stand and despised since kindergarten. No more being forced to live in a daily routine that I hate and finally being able to live my life on my own terms. Maybe one day, but I doubt I'll ever have anything to do with causing it. Maybe I would if someone approached me and asked for me to help them but other than that IDK. 

Who else would love for an apocalypse to happen within our lifetimes? ",1444086868.0

I'm out of country atm with no convenient internet. Before I left I discussed my plan of bulk purchasing wheel filters to a friend who's just offered to run the thing.

I won't have any involvement in the thing outside of passing on my credentials for my corporate discount, but he's a very reliable character and I'll be keeping an eye on his pricing to make sure he isn't over charging. 

The price will depend on the interest but I can say that at most you'll be paying chinafied filter prices for brand name, probably significantly less. In the interest of keeping all the prices down, the setup will be a simple email address/bitcoin type of arrangement, unless there's a workable alternative. I figure the filters will be offered in qtys from singles up to whole boxes (50-75, depending on brand).

If anyone has any advice on how to do this more efficiently (dnm's or amazon advice would be appreciated) or suggestions overall, we'd appreciate it. 

I'm back off into the bush but I'll check in asap. I hope everyone is well. Stay safe, family

edit: I'd also be interested if anyone thinking of buying has a preference in membrane material. I'll go with MCE unless someone would rather have PES. Once it gets going, we'll have some selection but right now it will be whatman or millex (~25-30 mm, luer) individually packaged sterile (gamma) 0.22um MCE.

Now that the nod is the first point of call, I feel I'm losing out. 

I tried dosing lower but instead of weaker high that I can prolong and use to build on and enjoy before nodding off. Instead it's just a weaker high. Hit a bit more and there it is, the nod back again.

Am I ever gonna get that glow? That euphoria? Etc etc? Has that ship sailed and is it just junkie existence from now on?

What if I switched up my DOC or ROI? Currently it's #4 white in measured lines straight up my nose at intervals to try and achieve the states talked about. First line and I'm a nodding mess though. Maybe my suff is too strong?

Is it better to CWE?,"I've been prescribed Co-Codamol for my back and shoulder pain (industrial accident years ago, raised it's ugly head again now in mid thirties). Current script is 8 x 30/500 per day, in either 2s or 4s depending on how much pain I'm in. 

Though my liver and kidney results recently were ""all excellent"" , is taking 4000mg of paracetamol daily dangerous? I know many people (my nan for instance) who are on a similar dose, but I've never been a fan of paracetamol, find Ibuprofen a much more reliable pain reliever, and a blind test between 4x 30/500 co-co and 4x 500mg paracetamol proved the para gave little to no pain relief, it was the codeine.

My wife worries CWE ""is weird and will make you addicted quicker"", however my next clinical review on the coco is a year away, I'd say a year of 8 per day would make anyone addicted, I just want to make sure I'm limiting any damage while making sure my pain is taken care of. 

A friend with similar pain issues talked about CWE to me, he's on a similar dose and I followed the steps to the letter, strained through 2 filters and it was clear in color, tasted awful but my back was less painful after around 15 mins, with mild sedation as expected.

Any advice will be appreciated. Doc is keen to avoid moving back to MST (we tried it for a couple of weeks) and to just hit it with heavy doses of co-codamol, and it *does* work, I'd just like to ensure I'm reducing any harm it could do, and the simplicity of CWE vs the benefit of removing *almost* all the paracetamol does seem like it's something I should be doing.

I was anxious as hell and just wanted to get home as fast as possible. When I left Impact they gave me back my debit cards and since I lost my job a couple of weeks ago I assumed I had money so I could get home. So at 12 I went up to the seniors office and told them I was leaving. They tried and tried to get me to at least stay the night but the anxiety was so real I refused. They warned me that it was about to start to pour rain and without a sweatshirt I was going to be in real trouble but none of that was a concern to me. They escorted me out of the facility.

I headed down to a gas station not to far to use an ATM and when I got there I put my card and pin in and checked the balance. 0.56¢ FUCK. I realized the mistake I made but there was no way I could go back now. I'm an idiot. Then it started to rain. I took shelter in a little cutout in a building and tried to get some sleep. I threw down some tee shirts and rested my head on them and fell asleep for a couple hours. 

When I woke up I was freezing cold. Nothing I did would help the extreme pain I was in from the pins and needles. So I stood up and waited for the sun to come up. A women walked by and asked if I had a cigarette. I told her I did but I needed to use a phone and she agreed. I called the only number I knew, my little brother and hoped to God he was awake. Nothing. I left a message explaining that I had checked out and the lady left. I started to panic. I was in a unfamiliar place with no direction. When the sun came up I took shelter in the business where I was waiting out the rain in. I stayed for a couple hours until they kicked me out and walked not knowing where I was going until I landed at a laundry mat to see if I could use another phone. Eventually someone let me and I got the same result as earlier. Left a message. I headed down to a bus stop and ask how they thought I could get home and got direction but I only had one gold dollar that happened to be floating around in my suitcase and prayed the bus driver would take it. He did.

I ended up in old town Pasadena and walked a couple blocks not knowing where I was. By the grace of God I stumbled upon the metro and hoped on towards union station without a ticket. When I got there there was 2 cops standing guard of the stairway down into union checking tickets. I followed the crowd and snuck by luckily. I found the train that would take me home and pretended like I lost my ticket but they wouldn't let me get on. I headed down to the ticket booth and begged people for a ticket. I finally got one. I wish I knew the lady that bought me one because I seriously owe her my life.

I ran back up to the deck and missed the train by minutes... I was pissed that I had to wait another 3 hours for the next train but remembered I was lucky to get as far as I had. Train came I boarded and we took off towards Lancaster. I couldn't wait to get off but I knew I still had to walk a long way to get home. When my stop came up I got off and started the long journey home. Every step was painful, I was starving, cold, and tired. I walked about 5 miles until I finally made it home and climbed through a window. My parents were not happy to see me and they contemplated kicking throwing me out hungry, broken, and with no direction but I was able to calm all the damage I had done over the last 2 years.

I'm on here often but as you can see this is a throwaway for now. Anyway, I wanted to ask two quick questions (the second may have a very long answer depending on peoples' experiences):

1) How amazing is this shit for getting clean and demolishing cravings? (I realized this wasn't really a question but was too lazy to change the above text). Feel free to ""answer"" (or respond/agree/disagree I guess.

The reason for Q1 above is just to introduce my history with subs, along with future plans. To give some background, I have been hovering around 2-4mgs of subs total daily for probably ~4 months with an occasional break to indulge in other stuff for isolated weekends. The latter ""vacations"" I give myself will need to eventually stop I know, but nevertheless I am very happy with the amount of control I feel subs give back to me (or they give me the strength to fight the rest on my own with support from friends/family/this community).

this leads to question 2:

2) Given my current plan to continue on low maintenance level sub doses that will stay at or lower than ~4mg total per day maximum, how would you guys recommend I manage my supply of subs? This is *NOT* meant to be a sourcing question; I am really asking a 2-choice question: Sub doctor + some sort of programs, or getting suboxone elsewhere without insurance or having to follow strict rules (which I know could be best for me, but I want to try this as comfortably and slowly as possible as I can; am always happy to try something new if I  feel like what I'm doing isn't working anymore). 

So the question is... how big of a weekly/monthly difference in price (obviously just estimated or based on your experience(s) since things vary so much depending on geography) is there between getting an ""average"" sub doc / monthly prescriptions vs. finding subs myself and paying ~$20 per 8mg strip. I'm sure this is an insanely high price, but that's the only other option I have, and I haven't had luck with doctors so far.

Part of the real reason I ask is because I much prefer just paying out of pocket instead of jumping through all the doctor b.s. hoops, but if I'm paying so much that finding the right doctor could save me an ENORMOUS amount of money, even over the span of a month or two, would be helpful info. 

I will keep searching for related threads on this here, but wanted to quickly pump this out before returning to work. Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.",1444228214.0

Basically, i've experienced what i've wanted to so far. I plan on getting clean fairly soon, and hopefully staying that way. I'm sure i'll still drink(not a big drinker though), I might smoke some weed here and there, and i'm sure my friends will still want to go to festivals and stuff like that once or twice a year where i'll probably drink/smoke/take acid/MDMA. I mostly mean from opiates(and benzos, don't have a benzo problem though).

But I feel like when i'm old and retired, or even a few years before retirement, i'll want to use again. I know I won't be smoking pot/doing acid and mdma when im like 38, but I could see myself doing that stuff again at 55 or 60. 

I'm mostly looking at opiates and benzos though. For one, it may change in our lifetime, but I feel like doctors prescribe opiates and benzos to old people willy nilly, and the ""good stuff"" if you've actually got problems. That, along with most likely having a very solid disposable income means I can enjoy drugs again without much worry. Some heroin while vacationing in London or Paris with a nice 30 year old prostitute sounds nice. Or my wife, if i'm married and bring her along.

Anyone else feel similar? I know with being older you kinda have to be more careful with doing drugs due to, well our bodies literally dying, but I feel like opiates wouldn't be too hard on the body and mind as long as they're taken properly. Not to mention, I would never be sick as I would always keep a ""safety stash"" of my meds/some suboxone.",1444224774.0

Nobody likes walls of text, especially not when it's a story we've all heard a million times.

Long time H user. IV all the way. Stuck in a cycle. Apart from the habit I'm a very normal person. Except from one drawer in my house and what's under my sleeves you couldn't tell I'm an addict.

I spend 3-6 months in any given year clean (or mostly). Eventually the crave comes back, then I'm chipping and before you know it habited again.

I've tried everything (meetings, rehab, detox, moving, sponsorship) but sooner or later I come back to habited and looking for a way out.. 

**Should I consider methadone long term? I've always refused it for many reasons (very hard to come off, visible side effects - always feel like I can tell someone is on it). I've been on Bupe before, but I was miserable (though circumstances were different).**

**I've been told the upside to Meth is that it still provides some of that opiate comfort, effectively occupying that part of my brain that is always screaming into my life to satisfy it.**

*Wouldn't that be just as temporary as my first bag? Won't I eventually need more and more for the same comfort? Will I be stuck on it forever, lose all my teeth and constantly be slightly sweaty? Isn't it like having an unsatisfying hit, like you can feel something but need more to be satisfied?*

I have a month to decide - Bupe or Meth?

**tl;dr** Lifer addict stuck in loop of detox and relapse. Could methadone offer me freedom from this lifestyle? I would like your honest accounts of methadone treatment to see if it might be what I need.

We set up a meet for the weekend at her place.   

I get there and when she opens the door I don't recognize her. Her nose has changed and her teeth are snaggly and crooked. She used to be a model and she still has the body but her face looks completely different. I don't know what it is, but when you look at her you just get the feel that she's a drug user - her face kind of ""deteriorated"" and it had that soullessness about it along with the empty stare. She was into the clubbing scene when we were dating and we would do a lot of partying together. Blow, MDMA, G, etc. I haven't done anything since then except the occasional drink - grew out of it.  

So we're sitting there and it's kind of awkward. She asks me if I want to do some blow tonight but I decline. She calls up her dealer anyway. ""Yeah, the usual, one gram. I have company so I can't hang out for very long."" Uh oh, that last line sets of some bells - she could be ""hanging out"" with her dealer for extras. We hang out and make idle conversation. Her dealer texts that he's downstairs and she runs down. She comes back and drops a small baggie with a gray looking substance inside in front of me - heroin. She gets a straw and a plate from the kitchen, empties the contents of the bag and crushes it with her credit card before snorting it all. My heart is crushed with it. She nonchalantly resumes the conversation while I sit there with my mouth wide open. ""So do you use often?,"" I ask while trying to be calm. ""Oh, you know how it is. I've been on and off for years but I'm quitting again next week!"" I kinda nod and wonder why I even stayed this long. But I feel sorry for her and I decide to question her further. ""How do you afford it?"" ""I'm an escort now. I usually do an appointment a day and that's enough to support my habit."" ""How much is your habit?"" ""About 300 a day."" I change the subject and she puts on a movie while I wonder how the fuck she fell off the wagon like this. I left shortly after the movie.  

I really liked her as a person and we stayed friendly over the years. In your experience, once you've been an on and off addict for years and you hang out with drug dealers, can you ever get clean? I didn't judge her, but I told her if she ever needs help getting off that I could help her. She laughed at me and said she knew what she was doing and that she didn't need help. She said she tried getting off a week ago by getting on Suboxone (don't even know what that is), but that it wasn't going to work for her because it essentially replaces one addiction with another. She said she tried quitting cold turkey but that it's too painful and she's going to wait until her sister is in town to help her with this. It sounded like she was making excuses and telling me things that I wanted to hear. Is there any hope here? Or should I just leave this as is and not stick my nose into other people's business?

The area is about the size of a quarter and it looks like a carpet burn or something. It is not raised at all, I am able to bend and straighten my arm and there is not a lot of pain, it's just kind of sore. I have been using hot/warm compresses, ibuprofen, and neosporin on it. The area is just pink/red. How do you know when to seek medical attention? What are the signs that it will not be something that I can handle on my own at home? I obviously really don't want to go to urgent care for this, but if I have to, I definitely will.

I had 40 of them left after the pain was over. 

My plan was / is to only take them on weekends. Taking one orally with fatty food, then another 4 hours later, gives me several hours of ""laying on the TV relaxed and happy""  -> good night sleep. Which is all I want. I don't want or need to get ""high"" I just really like that relaxed warm feeling. 

And now, in four weeks, I've gone through 10 of my pills. Little faster than I planned to but not too bad. I find myself thinking about how I might get more in the future. I have chronic back and knee problems and while percocrt is probably overkill I could probably convince someone otherwise. 

I see a lot of posts on here about people's progression to snorting / smoking / shooting - I don't see myself doing that - but I get the impression few people do. Many people saying ""I wish I could go back in time and throw those first pills away"". Is there anyone who manages to keep their shit together with lite / recreational / non addictive use? Or is this basically an unavoidable journey?

Edit: thanks for all the replies! I'll reply individually. tomorrow morning. Not sure if it matters, but I'm in my 30s and an engineering manager at a fortune 100 company. I work over 60 hours a week, sleep less than 5 hours a night, and am always strung out from stress at work. I can't use any stimulant (even caffeine) due to an arrhythmia I have. Alcohol is fine in small doses (3 or 4 drinks a night), but beyond that it'll cause my arrhythmia too. The percocrt doesn't have any cardiac symptoms. 

As for getting hooked, I have absolutely zero way to get any sort of opiate unless a doctor gives it to me. I'm an eagle scout with no criminal record and other than talking to people on here I've never known anyone who's sold drugs let alone bought them illegally. I've got way too much to lose to engage in illegal activities, especially with people I've never met. I guess my point is even if I get hooked, logistically it'd be basically impossible for me to get anything without the help of a doctor - but if I somehow managed to get connections I could go off the deep end and blow a shit load of money.

This story isn't about Baltimore, though. I got a new job in Delaware so I've been commuting up there from where I live like 40 minutes north of Baltimore. It all started when I ran out of rigs. For the previous few days from when this started I had been sniffing my dope and with my tolerance, that just wasn't cutting it. I normally buy my rigs off newegg.com, but in an emergency such as this, who has time to wait for shipping. So I tried buying points from a Rite Aid in Maryland and it goes without saying that I was shut down because I don't have a script for them. So, it was sniffing my dope me that day. The next day, I looked on Walgreens.com, and they said that in DE I could buy syringes without a prescription and it just so happened that there was walkgreens right by my work. So When I got off, I decided the first thing I would do is go in there and try to buy some points from there. Again, denied because of a lack of prescription which I knew was bullshit because of the website. According to the look that the pharmacy tech gave me though, I knew there was no winning this battle, Now this is where things get interesting. 

Due to the copious amounts of time I spend on /r/opiates I knew without a doubt that I would be able to buy them in PA, especially by Philly. So when left the DE walgreens I knew right there it was going to be off to Philly I went. Now, as I got closer I started to think that maybe in addition to rigs I would be able to cop in one of those two neighborhoods that are always mentioned on here. So, I did a search of the sub and got an approximation of where I needed to go. I head up there and park a block away on one of the crossing streets, leaving everything in my car except 80$. I walk to that one street and decide to take a left. I made it about two blocks when a homeless looking dude asked me (from across the street) if I was looking. I went to the crosswalk and met Carlos. My new friend Carlos said he would take me to the spot for 20$. Beings that was in a city that I really didn't know anything about I figured that was a pretty fair deal. Something about his toothless grin made me feel like I could trust this guy (lol). So on our walk to the spot, he asks me if I shoot and I tell him ""yes"" he then reaches in his pocket and hands me three rigs individually wrapped in the factory plastic. SCORE! Mission 1 was already accomplished. The rest of the deal went off without a hitch. He got me my six bags I asked him for, not asking for the money until we got right to the spot and I gave him the 20 dollars he asked for. He even walked me back 90% of the way to my car so I'd feel safe (not that I didn't, but it was a nice gesture). When I get back to the car i see that i had six blue bags with the ""Facebook"" stamp. I thought they were pretty good, and it had only been 13 minutes total from the time I parked my car until the time I returned with dope. SUCESS!

So, a two weeks go by, and in the meantime my main connect had decided he wanted to quit and I had been going through various other sources. I had a guy who gave FAT bags of just mediocre dope. I had a guy that gave SKIMP bags of fire. I had guys who were in between but no one who stepped up as the new number 1. So today I decide to tell my boss I have a ""doctors appointment"" and I decide to give philly another go. 

So I heap up, park in the same spot as before. Use the same ATM, except this time there was this chick sitting on a curb in front of this store nodding her tits off. I tap her on the shoulder and told her that if she can take me to the dope spot I would hook her up. This time, i got 8 bags of ""knockout"" and tipped her a 20$ even though she only asked for 10$. Also again, for whatever reason she asks me if I shoot  and again I say ""yes"". She reaches into a brown paper bag she had been carrying and hand me 5 rigs still in the packaging and says to keep all 5. SCORE. We get the dope and exchange numbers DOUBLE SCORE. Also, Again I was only away from my car for less than 20 minutes. When I finally got around to doing a bag it knocked my dick in the dirt. It was awesome. 
Now, for the PSA: I feel like it is a good possibility that these bags may be cut with fent. I got super high. But it wore off in less than 30 minutes. So maybe fent, maybe not, but I just wanted to let people who cop in that one philly neighborhood to be really careful with the ""knockout"" stamp. 

Anyway, hope everyone is well, and having a good night. Be careful out there fam!

TL;DR: cold copped in philly 10/10 would recommend. The second time may have been fent laced. Everyone be careful. ",1444169989.0

What is causing this to happen? I have heard a few theories:

1. Closure of ""pill mills"" and other policy changes have made it hard for people to get prescription opiates, so addicts are turning to heroin.

2. US involvement in Afghanistan has led to an influx of cheap heroin being smuggled into the US.

3. The oxycontin epidemic of the late 90s has created a generation of addicts that are now addicted to heroin. This is related to #1.

I started running about 3 months ago when I started reading Charles Duhigg's book called The Power of Habit. I started using U47700 about the same time, and running has been the best thing that I have ever done for my health. I started running and rewarding myself with food (going to get a lobster roll, getting Vietnamese food, etc) afterwards. 

I continued doing this and I have to say it changed my life more then any other thing. I was using Tianepetine to help motivate me to run, and it helped immensely. I was getting a bit too out of control chipping and after being on suboxone for 6 years and getting off, I didn't want to end up with another habit. Mind over matter is huge with this. Before I start running my head is a mess and all I want to do is get high. After the run, I feel good about myself and my life and feel very motivated. So in short, if you need an additional boost in managing your habits, running is the best thing you can do for yourself. 


""The neurobiological effects of physical exercise are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated neuropsychological changes. A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise (e.g., 30 minutes every day) induces persistent beneficial behavioral and neural plasticity as well as healthy alterations in gene expression in the brain; some of these long-term effects include: increased neuron growth, increased neurological activity (c-Fos and BDNF signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control over behavior, improved declarative and working memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and pathways associated with cognitive control and memory. The effects of exercise on cognition have important implications for improving academic performance in children and college students, improving adult productivity, preserving cognitive function in old age, preventing or treating certain neurological disorders, and improving overall quality of life.
People who regularly participate in aerobic exercise have greater scores on neuropsychological function and performance tests. Examples of aerobic exercise that produce these changes are running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming, and cycling. Exercise intensity and duration are positively correlated with the release of neurotrophic factors and the magnitude of nearly all forms of exercise-induced behavioral and neural plasticity; consequently, more pronounced improvements in measures of neuropsychological performance are observed in endurance athletes as compared with recreational athletes or sedentary individuals. Aerobic exercise is also a potent long-term antidepressant and a short-term euphoriant; consequently, consistent exercise has also been shown to produce general improvements in mood and self-esteem in all individuals.""

I got my hands on some Targin Modified Release Tablets 40/20mg.

They contain oxycodone HCI 40mg and Naloxone HCI anhydrous 20mg.


I have never used opiates before. I have used amphetamines and hallucinogens but no opiates at all.
My questions are:

1. What is the best way to recreationally use these tablets? I know that shooting them, or snorting them will activate the Naloxone which will cancel out the effects of the Oxycodone. So should i crush them and swallow with water???

2. How can i expect to feel after 1 or 2? Compared to say Heroin or actual Oxycodone tablets how ""good"" will these be?

3. Is there anything else a beginner should know when dabbling in this?

I'm both happy and sad. Happy because I got truly high tonight and I wanted to share that with some dope + weed porn with y'all. Sad, because I wrote an AWESOME post, like 3 nice long coherent paragraphs(with TL;DRs, im not a douche), and I nodded off for a second, hand slipped, I woke up startled because wtf, and closed the window. And that was after taking like 45 minutes to write all the shit out in the other post because high. I'll try and keep this as short as my high brain that likes to write a lot can, no promises. 

**TL;DR** : Sad cause I wrote a perfect post that took me forever cuz high, deleted by accident cuz high

I have a fairly high IV Heroin tolerance. I've used opiates on and off for the past 5 years, like 80% on and addicted the past 2-2.5 years. I mostly use BTH but ECP when I go back home to the east coast. **TL;DR** : oh fuck you read it

Anyway, i've used plenty. Got high plenty. But I haven't gotten HIGH, like that perfect great amazing high that makes you feel like ""shit, being an addict and spending all this money and going through w/ds would be worth it if every high was like this"". I haven't even nodded since January before this. 

**TL;DR** : oh fuck you read it

That changed tonight though. Basically, main dealer A got some new shit in. Stuff is primo. Daaank as fuuuuacckkkk. Solid 8 - 8.5 out of 10 when it comes to black. I tried it twice before, once when I still had sub in my system (nbd, not the best idea,  I knew I wouldn't get blasted, but it was only a dub, I felt it enough to be worth it, etc). Second time again was a dub (and .15 the next morning), which was great, much better than Main Dealer A and Main Dealer B's normal stuff. Still though, not blasted. The rush made me feel almost there, but didn't follow through 100% on the high.


**TL;DR** : One of my main dealer got some new shit, went from getting 5.5-7 / 10 shit to 8.5 / 10 shit. Tried a dub, shit was amazing.

I finally was able to cop for real tonight, and I got a half gram (for $50 too, not too bad. I hear people on here talking about paying $80 for a half G of black, that would make me quit!) I dropped .35 on the spoon with the non-alcoholic tap-filtered vodka and shot it up in 2 syringe shots (because im a fucking pleb and have only 1/2 ml syringes, they were free from a friend I met on here, so i'm not complaining). And holy shit.


**TL;DR** : Copped ""for real"" tonight, got .5 , did .35, basically had opiate orgasm. Best high i've had in years.

Heres some minor drug porn. I don't really post it ever, but I finally was able to get some solid pics.

**http://imgur.com/a/qnyw5**

First pic is just .2 of the black leftover I plan on saving for the AM. Gonna be an amazing morning I know it. Bang that, sit on this comfy ass couch for 15 minutes, get up and make breakfast + coffee. Hrrrnnnggg. Thing behind it is my wallet.

Second pic is my bowl, Donatello, and the marijuana, torn up by hand because I was too lazy to find my grinder. I also don't really care about min/maxing when it comes to marijuana.


Third pic is the nug! About 1.2g. Super dense. Not the best picture, but not too bad. I'm no marijuana pro, but I think that is one damn fine nug. Like damn. Zoom in on that shit. It's like crusted with orange hairs. Not just a few of them, but it's like a old fat italian chef's chest but died orange. The THC crystals are bountiful too, you can see better IRL, but they're more ""small and all the fuck over"" than ""big/medium/small and you can see every one bc micron microscope lol"". I think its ""greenhouse"" grown, rather than ""indoors"". It's deff not outdoors, or if it is, it's gotten like, the uptmose care and the best soil/sun/weather conditions heh.

**TL;DR** : **FUCK YOU READ IT ITS ABOUT POT**

These pics were  taken by an iPhone 6. This is the first time i've looked at pictures from my phone I put on imgur on my computer and DAMN SON THEY LOOK GOOD AS FUCK. /humblebrag. I'm still kinda on-edge when it comes to taking pics close up like that because my hands shake a quite bit (for no reason, just whenever. idk maybe I have tremors or early very not-severe parkinsons, hope not. Not caused by nervousness, but I think that makes it worse.) so I can NEVER get them in focus but fuck i'm happy I did!


**TL;DR** : Just talking about my camera and shit, and that i'm normally trash-level at taking pics, partially because my hands are basically Michael J Fox, besides them lacking talent.


So, any of y'all get that perfect heavy, strong, amazing high today or recently? How was it? Also, feel free to post your pickups for the morning/day/night. I'd love to see some BTH from around the states(or world).

The Selfless Addict

There once was a boy who gave without thought

It was how he was raised and what he was taught.

Some will say he grew up way too fast

For the once selfless boy this never would last.

He would try brand new things no matter the threat

All the things he had learned he would surely forget.

For this thing came along that would change his perspective

His life would now have only one main objective.

This once selfless boy now would lie, cheat, and steal

All for this one thing so he wouldn't have to feel.

Now this boy has become a man of his very own making

Without his selflessness, the world was his for the taking.

Like an endless cycle his life would become

Always looking for that thing to make him feel numb.

This boy turned a man was lost, trapped, and hooked

By almost everyone who knew him, he would be overlooked.

His only companion was his own worst enemy

Disguised as his friend it tricked him chemically.

Until the day he can be strong and say goodbye

He will constantly hear his poor mother cry.

It really is a sad story that this boy had picked

Because there is no such thing as a selfless addict.

I'm a long term user (over a decade now), used to use daily for 5-6 of those years but I cleaned up about two years ago.  I still relapse constantly (3-6 months) after a year totally clean.  Every time I go back the w/d just gets worse and worse, and every time I go back I tend to use heavily for 5-10 days.

I am considering just giving up and going on methadone/sub since;

1) I do have legitimate pain.
2) I know I can't control myself with opiates
3) I think eventually this pattern of use will kill me.  Either by way of OD or suicide.

I want to know if;

1) Methadone/Subs would keep the demon at bay
2) How this will screw me long term (legally and physically)
3) How much is the cost of therapy (I'm hearing $400 a month, is that correct?)

I've avoided this in the past because people tell me my tolerance is too low to go on them and I didn't want anything in my records.  Now my main concern is getting my life under control.  My tolerance IS low because I rarely use, but when I do use I blow throw massive amounts of anything I have on hand.  After two days my tolerance is massive and I'm blowing through a 100mg of oxy a day or bags of H.  Heroin is becoming a problem for me now due to it begin cheap and always available, with pills at least they were somewhat self limiting due to the lack of steady supply.

Right now I'm 4 days from my last use (Heroin, Opana, and oxycodone).  I still feel like shit with no end of w/d in sight, going on my past I'm still four or five days from feeling normal.

I've got two dudes and, besides being hispanic drug dealers, they are very different. Dboy #1 could definitely kick the shit out of Dboy #2. Dboy #1 is mid-20s and stylish with his Apple watch, artsy tattoo sleeves, and designer jeans. He has done some time, and is much smarter, more professional, and more cautious than #2. Dboy #1 usually has someone else driving for him in one of two luxury SUV type vehicles: either an indifferent and sexy bad bitch or one of his homies/business partners. They speak spanish with each other and act cautiously and cool. Nothing eventful here, just some young money associates and hangers-on from his hood in this wicked awesome city. 

Dboy #2 inspired this post. While he has great quality and is dependable, he is much more of a clown. Chubby and a little slow, #2 certainly won't roll up with any bad bitches in his tiny-cloth-seated-sundry-strewn-tinted-out sedan. The other day there was a silent white dude in there smoking a cig. While curious, I didn't say anything and I didn't ask. But today, and this is why I'm writing the post, there was a legit 350lb black behemoth slid all the way back riding shottie. Besides making heavy breathing noises he had a TOWEL covering most of his face and also said nothing. His general flabby demeanor almost made me laugh out loud as we circled a couple blocks to make the transaction. I so badly wanted to pull put my phone and capture ""that special moment"" as another bold-than-me user on here did recently. 

Anyway…anyone's man have some interesting characters that they roll with?",1444270463.0

That alone is enough to make me hate myself. Secondly I have no reason to be addicted as many of you do. I grew up in an upper middle class home. Great parents, not divorced, small town, good school, graduated college etc. I have never been in any toxic situations or dealt with problems like abuse, being poor, or really struggling at all. I dabbled in opiates in college and never was addicted but definatly would do them whenever I could find them, which was maybe once a month. Moved to a new city after graduation and got a good well paying job. Then one day I got the urge to do opiates but obviously being in a new city I couldn't find any. Then I discovered the other opiate sub we use and was introduced to heroin. After that it was an immediate spiral into addiction, needing more and more to keep me satisfied. I'm at a point now where I have spent all my savings and it's probably only a matter of time before my fiancee finds out. I literally hate everything about myself right now. I wish I could think woe is me, I have an addiction, its not my fault but it is. Its 100% my own doing and I have no excuse. Others on this sub have had terrible lives and are masking the pain by doing heroin. As bad as it sounds at least they have a reason for their use where as I don't. That probably feels the worst out of everything. Sorry for the wall of text, I don't really have any reason for this post besides getting it out because all I can do it dwell on it at this point. I have tried stopping but we all know how that is. Sorry if I seemed offensive if you were someone who had a terrible life and use dope to mask the pain, I did not intend it that way.

I had lied down after dosing aaaaand -- blank. I blacked out. Approximately 30 minutes later I ""woke up (I guess I'm lucky if it was just an opiate-induced nap)"" to a heart beating at around 120-140 BPM without so much as a buzz left.

It was really careless to nod on fent without a friend at my side who could give me naloxone if I needed it. I've accepted that and will be curbing my usage significantly after this little scare, regardless if I was tweaking over a nap.

I was pretty active in this sub a year ago and I posted every now and then. Well, I think my time with this shit is finally over. I overdosed on 9/11, about a month ago today. It was some bullshit if you ask me. It was nowhere near enough dope to take me down and I know it wasn't Fent considering my sister did the same stuff (while absolutely shit faced drunk) the night before in a higher quantity and was fine. There is no way with the tolerance I had that I should have fell out from the amount I did. And the weird part is, it didn't even happen right away. I did the shot, got a decent rush, got my phone and vape and went to (try to) take a shit.  I was all good sitting there reading reddit and smoking my vape, probably for about 10 minutes after doing the shot. Next thing I know I'm waking up on my bathroom floor still butt ass naked with my dad leaning over me and like 20 paramedics and cops all around. They said I was out for like 10 minutes and my dad said I wasn't breathing and my heart wasn't beating for about 5. But I woke up without narcan, luckily. 

So it was finally time to go to rehab. No if ands or buts. I spent 28 days in a rehab in PA (it was actually a great place if anyone is looking for one). Something in me changed there. I've tried to get clean before, but I haven't really tried. At some point in there I heard the right combination of things to make me want to get my life back. While I was there, 3 people od'd, 1 of which died, and the other 2 came back. One of my roommates while I was there was also shot and killed in a drug deal gone bad. It was a damn shame, he was such a smart and funny person and was only 21 years old. He had so much potential and it just kills me to hear about this shit killing people daily. I hate it. Absolutely despise that part. 

So anyway, I ended up coming back to Baltimore and going to a recovery house (again). But like I said, something is different this time. I want to do this. I can't put my family through any more shit and to be honest, I really don't want to die. There's a lot I want to do with my life, and dying would really fuck that up. Getting high would pretty much fuck that up too. I used to be so opposed to any 12 step program, but when it came down to it, it was because I didn't want to get clean. There are definitely other ways to do it, I just really don't have any better plans right now. It's definitely nice having people around you that are all working for the same thing. It's fucking terrifying and exciting at the same time, but I'm pretty sure we're supposed to feel shit like that when we're not emotionally numb. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this post, but I just wanted to get a message off from the other side for once. 30 days out, my sleep if returning to normal, I can eat again, and I want to actually live again. Live and enjoy things that life has to offer. I just hope I can hold on to this feeling and run with it, but I'm trying not to worry about that today. I figure if I do everything I can today I got a better chance in the future to keep this and get some of the shit I lost back.  Thanks for keeping me entertained and informed for these past 3 years though /r/opiates. I probably won't be here too often just because I really don't want to right now.

anyways last two weeks been basically just hitting it on friday.  im at the point where i can just take 10mg bumps casually. easily do 50-100mg in a couple hours.  puked a few times but like generally no nausea or puking.

now my buddies are into coke but i mean for example one buddy probly done u4 with me a half dozen times or so. sometimes just blazing/chilling sometimes while doing coke. he'd do 20-30mg in 10mg bumps over a couple hours or whatnot.  yet last week i gave him a normal 10mg bump and he felt like shit, nauseous, puked etc.  makes no sense considering he did 10mg bumps before.

yet another buddy who ive done u4 a few times with while doing coke handles it well. he can take bumps casually like me (not as often or as big tho).

yet another buddy did less than 10mg once and felt like shit and hated it.

finally another buddy one time railed 10mg of oxy and for a while his stomach hurt like it never hurt before apparently. he didnt puke or anything he just said it hurt like a bitch. but after that wore off he had a good opiate high.

- I have access to a chemist.

* The last 2 and a half weeks have been some of the worst nights of my life ever since u/UrbaNatured passed away. He was my best friend for the last 10 years, and I never knew someone could become that close to me personally. When we really got the deepest into our addiction together a couple years ago, instead of doing the normal junkie thing where you burn everyone around you in an attempt to score or get money and end up losing all your friends... Me and him only got closer through our struggles with addiction, we became blood brothers through heroin. We worked together for a while, but even when one of us didnt have a job we'd always take care of each other in an attempt for us both to never be sick, or not be sick for too long. One week he would take care of us, and spot me a bun here and there, The next week when I got cash and he burned through his I'd settle my score and give him more to hold him over too. It got to the point where we were inseparable. He sold a lot of pot for a long time so He'd come over to my place in staten island, spend a night or two here taking care of anyone over here who was in need of good product, then when we were done there we'd head back to his apartment in Brooklyn and stay a few nights there doing the same thing always getting high as fuck throughout the whole process. I swear their must have been a few stretches where we were going back and forth to each others apartments so much and just being together for a month straight without a day apart. I don't know how I'm supposed to move forward without him. Yeah the last year and a half we weren't together at all actually. He had moved down to Florida a few times to get clean through a 12 step in patient rehab and I ended up moving back in with my parents in the poconos to get away from all the crap I was putting in my arm in NYC and got myself into a suboxone program. It took him a few tries like it does for all of us, but this last time he generally seemed to be doing better finally...he had the longest clean time he's had in a years, almost 8 months completely clean, not even ""approved medication clean"" like I was for 15 months before I started being a weekend warrior these last 2 months and then turned into the fucking captain of the death wish squad after he passed away..But He had finished the programs, started hosting his own group meetings, became a sponsor to multiple people, found work and went at that full-time and even managed to save up enough to get himself out of the halfway house and get himself an apartment. Hell, he was even getting laid again finally after years of not having any sort of sex drive from mainlining too much heroin to ever want to even care about your own dick. We would video chat every 9-10 days to catch up and just generally chat about life and stuff... *here's where I feel like my guilt comes from, and what I blame myself for ever doing*
So I had started using on the weekends about 2 and a half months ago, and I opened up to him about it one day and told him about it and he was fine with it. Just told me to be careful and stuff, the stuff a good friend does. Anyway that eventually led to me starting to call him to video chat on thursday nights when I was going to do my first shot of the week, arguably the best shot of the weekend (my weekends are thursdays-saturday) but I mostly did this as a precaution to myself because even though we weren't together in the same room and he physically couldn't save my life himself, he knew my home address and the number to the EMT service that is provided in my community so if worse came to worst he could call them up and have them narcan my ass back to life hopefully. Anyway, we continued on this little tradition where I would video chat him usually thursdays or friday and we'd chat about life, how he's doing, etc and I'd do a shot or two. Obviously me doing this was making him jealous a bit, because I managed to find a connect out here in bumblefuck, and he didnt know anyone down there and had heard rumors about how florida has some pretty bad dope (thats why they put all the rehabs down here! he would say) so obviously he like all of us, even after months clean still wanted to just have that rush one more time, and i knew since he was living on his own finally and not in a halfway house it was only time till he was going to experiment a little himself. We had talked about it a bunch, and how he wanted to use one more time, to ""try it out "", to see what he was missing this last year, etc. He had asked me a few times to send him some dope through the snail mail and he'd pay me through western union and obviously I told him no, But I did tell him he needed to come visit me this summer up here in the poconos now that he's working and not in a program and can move around the country a little more freely again and that if he visited me I would gladly grab us a few buns from my local dealer and hook him up, cause I have narcan and I've done CPR to save someone before from an overdose when i didnt have narcan so I feel little confident in my abilities to save someones life in a situation like that. Anyway, he couldn't come to visit me until he had a roommate move in cause the bills from a 3 bedroom apartment all to himself were really killing his spending money, so our summer plans were put on hold. Eventually he had someone move in around the middle of sept. but by then i told him he should wait another 2 months at this point since its already getting chilly up here and we could turn his visit into a great snowboarding trip together. Im pretty sure that night when we talked about that snowboarding trip on video chat it was our last time we talked or saw each other before he passed away. So about a week after we had talked, it was coming up on time for our chat but I never got the chance to call him again later that week, because tuesday night I'm home, waiting around to do another shot of all things.....(I time out a certain amount of time between shots so they aren't a waste) and I get a call from my ex gf from Highschool, who I do keep in touch with but usually we just Facebook message or text each other so I her calling me was already odd. I answer the phone and she's acting weird, She asks me if Im friends with Adam on Facebook (a mutual friend of hers, mine and urbanatured's) to which I said I wasn't....She then said ""I don't know how to tell you this, but its about Joey (urbanatured)"" at that point I obviously knew something bad had happened, I hadn't heard from him in a couple days even through a fb message or anything but i didnt think anything of it because sometimes he's busy, considering he's working full-time, making new friends out in a new city, and pounding out young broads with his coke can chode cock lol. But when she said that I thought, *""fuck he must of crashed his mustang and got reallllly hurt, or even killed himself* cause he always loved to drive that convertible mustang like speed racer's retarded cousin,which I can say it quite fast and fun but slightly scary at times. I just never thought she'd tell me that he ended up overdosing and dying alone on his bathroom floor. Of all ways for him to die, after how well he was doing, how GENUINELY happy he was and just how innately and highly intelligent he was I didnt think he would either use something he didnt know the strength of without a baby test shot , or he would use for the first time in 8 months without at the very LEAST calling me first on video chat , or having someone around him to help in case of the worst case scenario....Thats why I still don't think he was alone, otherwise he wouldn't have done it alone in the bathroom like that without a backup plan (but thats another story for another day)

*So this is where my guilt comes in,and theirs a few different base reasons why i feel **GUILTY**

*  *Reason 1* 
**I have this ridiculous idea that I could have done something**

I feel like as his best friend its my job to look out for and help him in times when he cant help himself or care for himself properly. Yes I was in a different state and physically couldn't have helped him when he was already overdosing, but I feel like their had to have been a reason he didnt call or video chat me when he scored and figured out he was going to use again. Maybe I did something or said something that made him feel not comfortable opening up to me about it? yes this reason has a lot of holes in it, but I still feel as a best friend and brother I could have done something to change the fact that he was using alone, maybe he didnt score AND use the same day so If i tried calling him sunday night I would have been able to talk to him and he would have told me that was planning on using tomorrow and i could have talked him into getting on FaceTime with me while he did it so i could help call the EMT's if he fell out. It was his first time in 8 months, he had to have known that was a very big possibility. 

*    *Reason 2*
**Glorifying use in front of him multiple times**

As I said before, I would video chat him anywhere between every 7 and 10 days. And the last 2 months I've been constantly video chatting him when i was using, At first it started off as a safety precaution for myself not to die alone in a locked basement bedroom but then it just became a selfish habit to want to video chat him while i was using because it reminded me of, and felt like we were back together in our glory days of using together every single day like we did in NYC. Him seeing that Im using dope on my weekends, chipping ""Successfully"" , being a highly functional dope addict with a full-time job, good relationships with my family and the people around me, and just generally having fun with it again. That **HAD** to have influenced him at least a little bit in his decision to try it again, Ive only told one or two people about the video chats where I used in front of him constantly and they all say that if he wanted to use, he was going to use, it has nothing to do with me, or that i didnt put the needle in his arm, I didnt go out and get heroin for him to use. HE did all those things so he's a grown man, he knows what he's doing....and as much as those thoughts should make me feel better they don't.....and even though I will never know for sure if I glorified chipping to him and had a part in his dying because of it, I still feel a certain guilt surrounding his overdose and subsequent death. 

*  *Last reason*
**He might have thought because I didnt overdose, He wouldn't have either**

Joey was one of the smartest people I've ever had the pleasure of calling my friend, brother and 'bestie'. We actually originally met at the specialized High School in NYC that we both attended. For those who don't know what those are, basically they are schools where you had to test against 20 thousand other kids to score in a high enough percentile to win yourself one of the very limited and very coveted seats. Year after year our Highschool places in the top 10 on the list of top 100 High Schools in the country and 2nd in all of NY, only behind famous super school Stuyvesant...and I only mention all this to sort of shed some light on just how intelligent this guy really was. So thats why when I heard he overdosed, for a split second I thought it had to be intentional. Even though I guess we will also never know if it really was intentional for him to OD and die or not, I don't believe he tried to kill himself. I understand a lot of people may act happy before a suicide , but I know how my best friend is and he wasn't a suicidal person even when shit was really hitting the fan for him a couple years ago. So for him to kill himself now, when things were looking so much better in his life, It just makes no sense. 

So if it wasn't a suicide, why did he use enough to kill himself? Thats where I also at least partially blame myself. Over the years we always talked about it, and **MOST** of the time used the caution to do test shots if we hadn't used in a while or if we got some real expensive stuff that was RAW rock or just bigger sized bags than we were used to. Yes I can't say we did that 100% of the time, especially when were sick as fuck and just wanted to use. But about 90% of the time, when a situation came up like that we would heed the advice of this board and do tests shots instead of a regular 3-4 bag dose shot. So when I first started using again this summer, I did a test shot once or twice when I would start the weekend binge, but by the time I had started video chatting joey a few weeks into my chipping I was no longer doing that, and I was already doing bigger and bigger shots and he would see that...He would see me doing 4 bags in a shot, and having the time of my life when the rush kicked in and I would get a ringer and pins and needles. But the thing he didnt realize and probably was the reason Im still alive and didnt die those times, was because even though I was clean during the week, I wasn't opiate naive completely, I still had somewhat of an opiate tolerance from being on suboxone the whole time... and maybe thats what led joey to think he could do a fat shot and still be fine cause If i could do it, he could do right? Our junkie minds never make sense when we are trying to get ourselves high again...

 One thing that really bothers me is just not knowing more details surrounding his death....So 2 nights ago I went through his reddit history, because I wanted to see if he was active on here around the time of his death and I happened to stumble upon his last two comments he wrote which both happened to be on a board we aren't allowed to talk about on here, but everyone knows what that board is used for and what you can achieve by meeting up with the right people on there. So his last two comments were him saying something along the lines of, ""Thanks bro, good meeting up with you, you were super legit and we deff should chill again""

So I reached out to those two people who he was replying to on the board, and I tried messaging them to ask a few questions I just felt that If I got answered, they would at least help put my mind at ease over at least some of my guilt I have. Everyone tells me, why am I bothering, What good does having your questions answered do? Finding out more about his death's details won't bring him back will it? .....Well obviously it won't bring him back, but I do want and NEED to know somethings. Like, Was he actually alone that night when he died or did someone he didnt know well leave him to die alone on the floor after he fell out? Did he actually do a test shot and die from that cause of a fent cut or did he just end up doing a fat shot and falling out? Did he do more than one shot or did he die from his first one? Why was he alone, in a locked bathroom when he has his own apartment and bedroom? Why didnt he call me on FaceTime after he copped to tell me he was going to use, I understand I won't get all of those questions answered, probably not even half of them answered. But If I can just find out a little more details about his death it might help me get some closure that I Was denied when his family basically told every one of joeys friend, that his funeral and wake were closed to the public and only a special VIP family list was allowed to come.  

**IF YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR, THANK YOU. THIS IS WHERE YOUR ADVICE WILL NEEDED NOW THAT YOU KNOW AT LEAST MOST OF THE STORY ABOUT HIM AND MY GUILT**

* So after Joey died, What do you guys think I did? did the right thing and stopped chipping and used the memory of him to help send me back into my recovery program and keep me on the straight and narrow? .....well if you said yes, then you obviously didnt read what I wrote before about how I went from being a weekend Warrior the last 2-3 months, to becoming the captain of the *Death Wish Squad* these last 2 and a half weeks since his passing. The night after his death, when I had gotten the news from my ex. The first thing I did after I hung up with her was use, and then use some more. Then went to work high off my ass on adderall and dope, And continued that trend for days and days. In the immediate aftermath of his death, I had so many people reaching out to me to try and give me their condolences and to make sure I wasn't going off the deep end because they all knew how close we really were, All those people trying to tell me to talk about my feelings only made me retreat more into a shell of dope, adderall and booze. I couldn't have an idle mind during that time, I had to always be doing something or just so fucked that I couldn't concentrate on anything or think about what happened. I didnt sleep for 5-6 days straight while going on a heavy heroin and alcohol binge, with adderall as my only thing keeping me awake at work and throughout the days and nights. I also didnt tell anyone I was using, somehow I managed to retreat into my cave and hide and people didnt bother me because of his death. You'd think these people would be smart enough to realize what i was doing by myself that whole time, but I Guess no one realizes things until their too late. But here I sit, almost 3 weeks after the fact. Ive only spent maybe 2-3 days sober since that dreadful night. I tried doing a day sober after my week long, no sleep binge but I noticed the second the chemical happiness was leaving my brain and id start being able to think clearly and naturally Id get too upset and run right back to dope. And I knew this back then and still know it now, that all I'm doing is pushing the bottle of emotions back and back until i do eventually either get sober and face them which is going to be even harder after I put them off for so long, or I end up dead. Ive been doing heavier shots, more often, I haven't been sticking the weekend chipping schedule and haven't even bothered taking subs anymore. Im just spending all my time and money right now getting myself more heroin and even talking to joey in my head before my big shots saying, 'It should have been me' and that ""ill be joining you soon brother"" I don't mean to sound melodramatic but he played such a big role in my life, and in helping me deal with my problems when I had them, because he just understood where I came from better than anyone else. We were basically one mind in two different bodies. When people say you should talk about it, and I'm here for you, I tell them....the only person who would understand me and I could talk about it comfortably to, is the one in a box buried in queens. So right now, for me. 
Its come down to either I get some **REAL** advice, from people such as yourselves who may know a way for me to get over my guilt and learn to cope with life without a brother like joey, or I'm going to continue on this path, burning up all the clean time I had and life's ambitions in hopes of just doing one last shot that puts me in the dirt next to my friends.

Im sorry I didnt proofread this too much, I did the best I could as I was going along to not have TOO many run on sentences...but knowing how I just opened up my mind and poured everything out into this writing, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a terrible mess with no formatting and little cohesion to it all. I really hope someone, even if its just one person who reads this and can give me some sort of guidance cause otherwise I cant see myself making it to my 24th birthday in a few months.

All new beginnings and sad endings.,"Well, my Papa has passed away. So sad. He was great. My other Papa who was my Dad's Dad passed away when I was so young and barely old enough to remember him, but this Papa I got to actually know and have great memories of. So if I could ask this Sub that's full of caring and genuinely nice people, if they could just take a moment and share this moment of silence with me. Thank you all so very much.

On another note, let's celebrate a new life. My sister just had her second child 10 weeks ago. She has a 5 year old son who is obviously my nephew, but this time she had a baby girl. So here's where I shout out - ""I HAVE A NIECE, EVERYONE!!"". I really am so happy and full of joy! Just seeing my niece gives me, not only a reason, but also a WANT to get clean. Looking into those beautiful blue eyes and seeing her innocence is an awesome feeling. It rips me apart at the thought that one day she will find out about my using and my OD this past May. I feel so alive and full of life and naturally happy without the aide of drugs whenever I see her, that she may be what I needed to get clean, and STAY clean. I don't know why, but from the first time I laid my eyes on her I knew that she was special. I know that she's eventually going to be a beautiful, brave woman. If after only 10 weeks of being alive, can she make someone who has been using the past 10 years consider to really, really quit this time...Who knows what effect she'll have on other people throughout her life. And she already loves her Uncle Mike.. we can all tell. Whenever I hold her facing me she automatically puts her head on my chest and puts her arms as much as she can around me like she's hugging me. And she smiles for me and just OMG - she's so adorable. I know everyone says babies are cute and all, but really she is just so fricken cute it's nuts! I don't have kids of my own (should have but lost them before they could be brought to this world), so I treat my nephew sooo good, and now I have a niece to spoil!! Thanks for reading everyone. I really do appreciate it. 

Here is a picture of my silly nephew (Noah), my lovely niece (Ellie), and myself (Uncle Mike).

Apologies about the long post, I ALWAYS fuckin post way too much when im high. I'll write a short description at the top of each section soyou can see if you wanna read it or not lol. 

Posting some BTH porn here because i've only seen it like this very few times(and have it be better than 4/10 lol). I mean it doesn't look all that good but I have never gotten BTH(even hard shit) this broken up. It's ""raw"" BTH. Raw as in, it's prob been cut 2-3 times since it got to me, but I know for a fact my dealer didn't cut it. $120/g but got it for $100 because of a misunderstanding and me introducing him a new client. 

http://imgur.com/a/NeFHJ   

**INFO** : Talking about the raw in the pic and the couple other types of BTH I get/rating them.

**First pic**: Stuff is pretty good. Did about .3 in 2 50 unit syringes (1/2ml each i think? sucks but i got them for free and was out of syringes o im not crying). Medium legs, about 3.5 hours. Seems short for most people I think but I have NEVER had any luck with even super high doses of  many diff kinds of opiates lasting ""long"". I'd say 7.5/10. The normal raw this guy has (Lets call him Guy A) is either more of a chocolate brown and comes in a chunk or two, that's a solid 8/10. The other raw he gets sometimes i's this tan powder that when hot air/breath is applied, or it is rubbed between fingers(tiny pinch o the powder) or its put into warm/hot water, it turns into BTH. Dark brown color. This stuff is for sure a 8.5/10. The third ""raw"" I get idek how ""raw"" it is, its from another guy (Guy B), $100/g, and hands down the best BTH I have ever had. 0.3 put me on my ASS. 9/10 for sure. I have never really craved a specific high from black or type of black but this black literally made me crave the exact same specific high for quite long time periods. **BONUS** : Hard Rock Las Vegas card. Keep on rockin.

**INFO** : More talking about raw, focusing on the suuuuper good/best BTH I have had shit.

**Second Pic** : The infamous 9/10 raw I get from guy B, about 0.25 worth. He had it in stock for about 2 weeks. Prior to this he had ""normal"" stuff that ik for sure he didn't cut (doesn't know how) lol that ran $80/g and was about a 7/10, sometimes 7.5. I'm sad, I hope he gets it again, he was back to his normal $80/g stuff today. It's soft/super sticky and smelly on the outside, inside was denser and kinda crisp/hard/gave a little ""crack"" type noise when I cut it in half. This pic is from a few days ago, but I wanted to share. This little 0.25 I had the morning (well, noonish) the night after the pickup was great. Super high, rush was intense enough that I nodded(never happens to me off BTH, was only for a sec but still). Legs lasted a full 4 hours, maybe a lil longer. I also was not able to get stuff until like 830 pm the next day and I was not sick one bit! Stayed in my system hah. Well worth the money!

**INFO** : Just talking about the dank nug of marijuana in the pic, talking about why I don't smoke pot hardly and why that changes when i'm home on the bEast coast.

**Third Pic** : This is a sample of some dankity dank Orage some shit. No idea the strain, just know it's Greenhouse from the Emerald Triange and that its good. Half a bowl (3ish big hits) and i'm in fuckin lala land. Super dense, the nug weighs about 1.3g and is maybe as wide a 2 quarters and a dime(like a triangle shape)?....While I use other drugs besides opiates, weed is not often one of them. Well, it depends if im back home on the East coast or at school on the West. West, I smoke once in a while after class with friends, at parties/after parties, and once in a blue moon with a girl before, netflix opiates and ""cum inside me baby me im on birth control!!!"". If i'm back on the East, I smoke damn near every day. I get a ""wyd"" text around noon, ""nada just got up about to get ready"". ""tight u wanna smoke and get some subs(food not drug lol) or a mcgangbang?"" , ""yeeee muhfucka! scoop me in 20"". This is how a LOT of afternoons go. And then 95% of the time, were at someones apartment smoking at night, usually with some 40s and music. Either from like 8-10pm while we pregame a party or bar, or 9/10pm - ???(usually 2-3am) if were just kickin it, or have a few girls over, or have a tiny party. Idk man, I like weed, its great, don't get me wrong. But I get bad social anxiety a lot of time when i'm high. Not bad at parties but otherwise. Also, I am a pretty lightweight, so people kinda are like ""wtf""? towards me(not in a mean way) when I say i'm down to smoke but only cheif 4-5 hits off like 2 blunts going aroud. I really should smoke more pot, it helps me with quite a bit of stuff. Just not when i'm going to the mall LOL.

**INFO** : Really dickhead? Read it. Just talking about the diff bud in the pic.

**Fourth Pic** : Just a pack of some greenhouse OG Kush (I believe, that's what I was told). I have smoked this stuff once a few weeks ago, was dope. Strong. Was in a joint that I only hit twice but still, and had a great taste to it. Hard to describe. 


**INFO** : If you like hip hop, read this shit. Talking about the stupid pic, but talking much more on opiate use in the rap game right now, and showing one example of a popular rapper that was/probably isn't but may still be a Heroin addict.

**Fifth Pic**: My man FUTURE. Great rapper that makes semi-ig'nant. Just put this here cause I think the picture is funny. What is y'alls opinion on Promethazine with Codeine Syrup in Rap? It's been in southern rap for-fucking-ever but really only got popular when weezy and a select few others started talking about it prolly back in 2004-2005. It kinda blew up then plateaud until like 3 years ago when more up and coming rappers that are now very big (IE, A$AP Rocky, Danny Brown to a lesser extent, Chief Keef, Future, The Weeknd, Schoolboy Q) started including more shit like percocets/xanax/other pharms in their raps along side purple drank. A lot of the ""New School"" guys coming up do it even more too(Travis Scott, the guys from Awful Records in ATL, Joey Badass, a lot of the lessern known A$AP guys and their squad of people like Heir Dash, Joey Fatts,   I mean, we all know sizzurp sucks (besides that sweet, sweet, orgasmic yellow hydrocodone syrup, hrrrrnnggg). I mean, we all know sizzurp blows unless you're using it to potenate real opiates or you have like, negative opiate tolerance. But how do these rappers keep using and using syrup without switching to harder opiates? I mean, i'm sure plenty of rappers have taken more than their fair share of lortabs/percocets/probably even blues. And of course its next to impossible to really know what their addiction is like since you don't know them. But I just find it crazy that someone like Future has been sippin lean for YEARS, probably has been addicted for quite a few of them, and most definately goes through w/d without it. Theres no way hes drinking enough Lean to get high any more, he's gotta put some percs or blues in there and drink those with his syrup. Part of me thinks that the syrup is just a front for his image/drinks it out of habit since is a big part of his image and songs, but he actually takes plenty of pharma opiates. What do you guys think about that? Random, but I know for a fact that Mac Miller got HEAVY into Heroin addiction. I don't have a link but he mentioned something about H in a song, he got asked about it in an interview and elaborated a little bit but this was like 2 years ago. He's been putting out fire shit ever since though so i'm not mad hes clean haha.


So yeah, I kinda included it in the last chapt...I mean last paragraph but I KNOW some of you lazy muhfuckas didn't read it. What do y'all think of opiates in the current state of the rap game? Rappers you fuck with that rap and prob fuck with opiates and/or pharms? Know any rappers that are using the heavy shit like heroin, fent, or oxymorphone? What do you think is the deal with a lot of rappers and lean? The ones that are addicted like Future gotta be using other opiates right? Theres no way that rappers can sip syrup 5 -7 days a week for 2 years without getting addicted, tolerance going up and not getting high any more, etc.

Yes, I do see that there's some absurdity in that I regularly use heroin, a street drug with no guarantees on purity. I do not use H everyday. I am a mental addict for sure, but I stay away from full blown physical addiction...mostly because I cant afford to be one.

Anyway, with heroin, and most other mind altering substances, we feel the effects very quickly. SSRIs freak me out because there seems to be so many side effects, and they don't even start to ""work"" for multiple weeks of daily usage. Of course, they are also intensely addicting, with hellish withdrawals.

So basically, do any of you guys take an anti-depressant? What is your take on the effects? Do you see improvement in your mood/life? What about combining this drug with opiates? Is this extremely dangerous or relatively benign? I hope someone here can help me out, as I would love to feel less depressed, but I'm not sure SSRI, namely Celexa, is a good way in which to do that...

Thanks for reading.

All we had were Norco 10/325s so we both popped 6 and drank a couple beers. He has a pretty high tolerance, he shoots Opana and Roxy on a semi-frequent basis and takes those Norco to stay well. Anyway, he started feeling really sick so I asked what all he had taken today and he said that including the 6 he ate since I've been over, that he'd ate 22 of them throughout the day...  He says he feels nauseous and dizzy, he's tried to throw up but can't. We dunno if we should be too concerned or not cause the toxic dose for acetaminophen is 10,000mg and he's had 7,150mg throughout the course of the day. What should we do? I'm scared to death I don't want anything to happen to him. Help.

TL;DR- Buddy ate 22 10/325 Norcos over the course of the day, never got that high but is feeling like total shit because of all the acetaminophen. Dunno whether to be concerned or not or what to do in the event that we should be.

EDIT- He has Narcan on hand.
DOUBLE EDIT- He just threw up and says he feels a lot better. It's not the first time this has happened apparently. Got him drinking a lot of water. Thanks guys.",1444445692.0

Not to mention the fat fucking speedball I know I have in my bag. 

But until then I'm riding shotty with one of the most loyal chicks I've met. Her fiance apparently got out of prison a couple of months ago. 29 months. Saw him every visit. Answered every call. Had HIS GANG'S back with rides, and help, even food. Picked up his game to hustle money for his books. Never cheated. And allegedly (someone else told me and I'm not asking) brought him drugs a couple of times. They've been together since they were 16. Shes 24.  She said he proposed the day he got out. 

I'm in awe. At her, her dedication, her loyalty, her intelligence (she has a BA in education, just graduated summer semester, speaks 3 fucking languages. Spanish English and fucking German), at her beauty as a fucking person. He is one lucky son of a bitch. When I was asking about her when I knew I'd be riding with her, I wasn't expecting this. It wasn't me stereotyping her it, it was me forgetting the type of people that are out there.

Then there were her compliments. Jesus. She thinks I'm some great fucking person because I've been helping out. And every time I tell her a reason why I'm a peice of shit, she says ""oh well, shit happens sweetie. You're great. They love you being around."" No. Stop. I want to throttle her and remind her I'm a fucking junkie who is doing this for a place to sleep. But she doesn't care. I have no idea how to handle this. I'm so used to people shitting on me, that when they don't, its so fucking foreign I want to turn tail and hide. I'm uncomfortable her being so nice and understanding. 

I just wanted to let you guys know how incredible some of these people are. Some of them have been shit, but damn. She takes the cake. I'm glad I'm riding with her. ",1444440679.0

I have been flirting with opiates for five years with only weak opiates.

I don't like weed, alcohol, psychedelics or dissociatives..they only make either my body or my mind feel 'foreign' to me. It's only opiates I'm interested in cause they make me feel 'natural' in a way that I have always wanted to feel.

I have no beliefs about me being any different in  a way that I would be able to keep it under control and do for example heroin only weekends. I have read about people thinking that they could handle it and do it like only twice a year or month or something. Then I read their forum posts a few years later and it turns out that they were no different from others, they either couldn't keep it under control....

I see it is only a matter of time before opiates turn into a daily habit.

Now I've been having these dreams of poppy fields and my aunt giving me a handful of oxycontin 80s.

I was close to buying oxycontin a few weeks ago but decided to read some diaries from people going through oxycontin withdrawals and decided that maybe it is not for me. I know I should not even try it but I want to know how it feels? I am scared

Deep down I hear a voice saying 'you don't want to go down that road kiddo'..I really don't want to live my life going through a shitload of withdrawals and in and out of rehab etc.

I don't want to make same mistakes as others have but I'd like to skip all the bullshit withdrawals and rehabs and detox and just learn from people who have been down this road and know what they do after? What do they do after all the withdrawals and quitting etc, how do they live their lives? 

I feel like people have been battling these same questions since the ancient times and are no wiser.

after the pain became too much for him to ignore/bear, we finally set off to the ER for what we thought was just muscle spasms. on top of his asthma. nope. turns out he has **Endocarditis**. he went into the hospital right after the symptoms started getting bad, so they should be able to take care of it. 

unfortunately, he is in the Wake Forest hospital in Winston-Salem, some bad experiences at the Greensboro hospitals have left him leery of them. since i cant drive, im not able to see him as much as i'd like, but im going tonight with a couple friends. if any of you would like to say anything to him, you should do it in the comments here.feel free to PM him too, but i dont know how much time we'll have there,  but if we cant stay long im just going to show him this thread. he wont want to waste precious visit time going through his inbox, im sure.

ill keep the updates coming, if you guys want to do whatever you do when people are sick, we would appreciate it. chant, or pray, or sacrifice 7 virgins or something. he used to be Russian Orthodox, and played organ for Episcopal/Anglican churches, so maybe somebody can put in a word with bearded Russian Jesus or aloof British Jesus.

i hope he gets home soon:(

I had no withdrawal effects from the suboxone until 2 days after take the .5 the only effect I got was the kicks in bed so I had a spare Ropendole  This is a medication used I believe for Parkinsons it does something with dopamine in the body it stops the restless legs.

Something to add I still at day 10 am taking the Gabapentin 800mg 3x a day and I smoked about a half ounce of weed during this period. I feel fine and my at home detox has been successful. I'm getting the vivitrol shot wednesday morning. Day 13.

I'd like to hear other peoples detox experiences and answer any questions for anyone wondering anything

*****************UPDATE************ 11/17/15
So I'm still clean but not continuing vivitrol I don't know if it was the naltrexone or just coming off of a 5 year daily run with heroin; but I felt like a zombie I would catch an hour sleep here an hour sleep there, stay up for 2 days, crash for 4 hours. It was messed up I lost sense of all time. I tried my hardest to do daily routine stuff you know kind of fake like I woke up at 7am and make breakfast take a shower get dressed walk the dog. This seemed to really help as far as depression or the sense of emptiness some people have told me they experienced upon cessation of opiate use.  I have actually felt empowered, not depressed at all. I started taking a natural supplement called DL-Phenylamine often abbreviated as DLPA. This is a precursor to L-Tyrosine which synthesizes into Dopemine and Norephenerine. Within two days of taking it my head stopped feed so foggy and my cognitive ability was 'normal'. I will admit I did have an attempted relapse around day 22 thinking the vivitrol shot was nearing its end of life and either it was completely blocked out or it was bullshit dope. Regardless I have no desire to use heroin and have had daily opportunity to use. Like I said, I feel empowered. I enjoy life so much more, heroin hijacks the mind and steals the soul.",1444570654.0
3obdka,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3obdka/methadone_reduction/,0,https://redd.it/3obdka,Highfire2,Methadone reduction.,So I've been off since Wednesday had my last bag Tuesday night then got up and took 60ml of done felt fine through out the day with no WD Thursday I took 30ml and about 60mg of dihydracodiene (DFs) few hours before bed slept fine and got up about 10am took the last of the done 15ml and think I probably took about 240mg of DFs  through out the day . Got up on Saturday with a little bit of a runny nose but nothing bad and took 60mg of DFs and that sorted it . I felt alright not as good as when I was on done but nothing compaired to full blown WD and took about 200 odd mgs through out the day. Took a little bit to get to sleep last night but managed to .Got up this morning about 10 am feeling not to bad no physical symptoms just had 60mg and a couple of coffees and it's all going well 😊 Through out this though the mental addiction has been there some what and was more noticible yesterday as I was thinking about going for H  but managed to push it out my head and not give in. Got things to do today so that should keep me occupied and not thinking of dope . Ive used methadone before to come off H and it's (for me) the easiest way to do it and really limits physical WD . Not quitting for good or anything just taking a little break to get tolerance down plus I need to spend money on something else at the moment so can't blow it on dope.

It's been two years since I ended a 6 month long daily IV period, preceded by 6 months of sniffing.  Not even that bad, compared to most of you.  The last shot wasn't even a solid-sendoff either, it was to keep the sickness away.  But I got through the first day, the first weekend, the first week, and the next thing I knew was that it was two years later.

2 years.   It's been 2 years since I graduated school.  Got a decent paying job.  Moved out of a junkie squat.  I even can cook and play guitar pretty well!  I've made some progress since scraping off stamps to get another 'shot'.

2 years.  It's been two years since I spoke to anyone about my heroin addiction.  There was one friend who knew before, during, and after it started, and kept me safe to the best of their ability, without condoning or condemning.  They mean the world to me, and nothing I can do will ever repay them for their support.  It came up with a couple other friends, but they showed their true colors once they realized I was just another 'opifeen'.

2 years.  I've woken up every morning for the last two years and my first though its ""I want a shot of dope"".  It doesn't feel very good.  The next thought is that I need to get out of bed.  Make coffee/breakfast.  Take shower.  Go to work.  Go to bed. Repeat.

2 years.  It's been 2 years since the last needle came out of my arm.  Two years of rebuilding my life, relationships.  I have new hobbies, new friends, and an overall healthier attitude towards life and body.  In a one on one conversation with someone today, 'bad things in the past' came up.  I foolishly mentioned my H problem, and the dynamic instantly changed.

what do you do if you've struggled with opiate dependency almost half your life, ending in a miserable, unshakeable heroin addiction, but it all started from being prescribed meds for actual, legitimate pain...that unfortunately remains 24/7 when opiates aren't being pushed through the blood stream in mass quantities. 

this isn't me, but my bf, who broke his back snowboarding 11ish years ago. I can't imagine having my already crippling psychological need to shoot dope extend into the physical world. it sounds like a nightmare, and I'm having to watch him live it every day. he can't do anything too physical without serious pain, and no matter what, at night he's stuck staring at the ceiling, unable to get comfortable (unless his mouth is hanging open and he's in a deep opiate induced slumber, of course). often, the pain has even stopped him from being able to have and/or enjoy sex, which sucks ; especially when our sex life is already so ravaged by dope. 

well, now that he and I are trying to get clean, after a pretty successful and long 9 month binge, I expect and fear that that interruption by pain will be even more noticeable. obviously, ibuprofen doesn't do Shit. opiates work, but then they work too well and cause too much Shit. will a pain clinic even give a Shit, once they realize they're dealing with a junkie?

I just can't imagine they're aren't options (although he claims every one he's known in a similar situation has only ever suffered, and continues to). but...there are just too many overlaps between the junkies and the physically pained and injured! so far, I suggested he talk to his sub doctor who he's seeing this Tuesday. oh yeah, and he's taking subs, which I assumes makes a big difference.

I love opiates and believe I have a fairly good knowledge on opiates. Much of this knowledge I attribute to the many posts on this thread. However, I realize there are a lot of people who know way more about opiates than I do. I have a few questions I hope some people can answer, but first let me explain the background story that lead me to this questions.

First, I haven't really fucked around with hardcore opiates a lot such as oxy or heroin. The strongest opiate I've taken is hydromorphone, but that was only once. I've taken all types of hydros on frequent occasions because I had a great access to them. But anyway, I recently met this d-boy that lives very close to me. He sells heroin, pills, and anything he can get his hands on really. He offered me ""china white"" and I was under the presumption that this was heroin. I politely declined. A few days later, he offered me some roxy's along with what he called ""beans"". He explained that the beans were way more potent than the roxy's and told me that it was fentanyl gel which he freezed and then scraped off, cut, and put into a gel cap. I opted for the beans, as he told me it was worth way more of my money and would get me way higher. 

After repeatedly snorting the powder in the beans, I realized that it had very, very little affect. The affect could even have been placebo. I don't know how many mg of the powder was contained in each ""bean"", nor do I know how many mg of the powder I snorted on each occasion. In another interaction with this d-boy, he then told me that ""china white"" was actually the fentanyl powder with the cut that he sold to me in the beans. I was confused, because I thought china white was heroin. 

So my questions are, what the fuck am I putting up my nose? I know fentanyl is an extremely strong opiate, so I was expecting to get really high. However, I barely caught a nod--much less even a buzz off of the powder I was snorting. Another question I have is: what is china white? I did some online research on what it was, and I concluded that it was heroin cut with fentanyl to potentiate the high. This being said, I feel like I should have gotten properly faded off of these things. Am I just not snorting enough? I don't snort the whole pill, maybe a 1/4 of the pill at a time.

I have a decent bit of this powder left. I might just snort the rest of it to see if my problem is that I haven't been snorting enough. However, I don't want to risk hitting a hotspot with the fentanyl, but I really don't think that will be an issue. He may have just cut his shit waaaaay too much. Finally, can fentanyl be taken orally? I was also thinking about swallowing the rest of the powder, but I don't know anything about the oral bioavailability of fentanyl, or if this is a good idea at all.

Sorry for the inorganization of the questions, I'll post them all here below:
-Has anyone heard of these ""beans""? If they really are a common thing, what has your experience been with them?
-What really is china white?
-Am I not snorting enough of this powder? Or did I just buy crappy product?
-Can fentanyl be taken orally?

[serious - mental health],"I was surprised by some of the replies in the Tinnitus thread, because all these years in my heroin 'career', Tinnitus was one of the things that disappeared 100%. Even when I am in withdrawals, it never returned again, and I am thankful for that. I have come to the conclusion that the tinnitus disappearance has 20% to do with Heroin and 80% with my benzo addiction.

**BUT**

I have **another** condition, which is a by-product of my anxiety disorders. Since I was 12-13 years  old, I was listening to music in my head, all day long. When I wanted to sleep, it got to the point where songs stuck in my head were playing as if I had a radio/cd player next to me. It was that intense, and borderline psychotic (although my docs said it was not psychotic, just a result of obsessive thoughts in form of music).

It reached a point -before starting Heroin- where it was almost a handicapping condition due to the insomnia, stress and panic attacks it would create.

Heroin, but mainly Benzos (I'm on 2mg to 4mg Flunitrazepam per day), made this 'music thing' disappear. Unfortunately, this is the condition that returns X 1000 when I'm withdrawing, or even when taken a smaller dose than my desirable one.

I know it sounds funny, but it is very cruel, and it interferes with my life AND job. Kinda belongs to the obsessive thoughts department, only musical, and usually with songs that are popular; I wish it was calm, ambient music, but alas...

And my weekend begins with another lump of coal from Black Santa. This tar is a bit softer but does still snap when broken, doesn't need freezing. My nose is fucked so I cant smell anything, but it tastes pretty smooth when smoked, melts easily and does well on foil, and doesn't taste like complete shit ( I can actually hold this stuff in after a hit without a problem)

I know some have mentioned that good dope doesn't leave marks on foil?  Is this right? I've bought dope from a lot of different sources and never came across any that didn't leave black trails when finished of some residue...I doubt there is dope that vaporizes completely is there? Even crystal meth leaves something there...

In my experiences, some dope flows easier on foil and the ""beetle"" moves smooth.....I'm guessing really bad dope doesn't liquefy well and kinda just burns away and doesn't flow down the channel

Snorts pretty smooth with mannitol, I like how using mannitol gives it a slightly sweeter  taste, better than clabber...although I've noticed mannitol tends to clump a bit so a add just a tad of BP to help with this..and a lil benadryl to deal with the itching.

So I ran out way early and have been suckling it up. However I just found an amazing local connect and I swear I wish we could fucking yelp review this people. Dude was 110% legit and chill to boot.

So I load up the shot after reading lots of posts on here. Usually my dillys are crush stick ahhhh, henchmen the screen name.

So to me it could be baking soda but it did have the vinegar aroma to it and was little darker brown when wet. Prepend in a spoon and let it cool for a bit. I used salinger solution dn drew it up. At first I felt nada but I'm so used to the dilaudid rush, I've been spoiled. So I didn't get that but slowly it rolled up on me and bam that euphoria. I can say as a LONG time user of dilaudid this is by far a better over all euphoria and from what I have read is going to last me a little longer. I am pretty impressed though its the first I've tried, and I also took 5mg alprazolam sublingually. So I am pretty damn chill with my 4k Sammy cranking out Age of Ultron in all its 5.1 glory. The neighbors are away so I can't wait to see what the hulk buster fight sounds like.

So ultimately it def fills the opiate void 7ntily script on friday. I'm not sure if I want to shoot all of it and ming insuffulate a few times just for safety and longevity. I am however defiantly trying the unicorn mix of my dilaudid and this H. I'll do have my normal 4mg pill and half a bag instead of one while one. I'll review that next Friday night.

They didn't have suboxone pills, just subutex. I figure subutex is better anyways cause it doesn't have that extra ingredient.... thoughts?

3ojz82,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3ojz82/i_love_you/,13,https://redd.it/3ojz82,morbo2000,I Love You,"The gods walked down from the stars and were once again welcomed to the planet.  A world thirsty for gods and magic.  But it won’t last.  It never does.  Fake gods created by clever humans will conquer spiritual belief.  More often than not, one man’s greed will destroy the planet...but seriously, just let it go.  Whether they vote to destroy the world together or one madman decrees this, it still blows up.  Again and again.  

 Usually a cleansing fire washes across the planet.  Then it will reset.  

 And for your kind, there is always room for the Gods.  

You know that feeling you have that there is more to your shitty life?  If you have pushed against the barrier between life and death, you felt the gods.  In their presence, you glimpsed meaning.  You see the gossamer web strands spiraling from your heart to all the people that loved you.  The ones you touched with your Light.  Oh how they loved you….

 New gods, old gods and changed gods.  The excitement of a world born again.  And like commuters sipping morning coffee before another work day, the gods prepare for their shifts.  And so hand in hand, the two binary stars walk from the Darkness back through Aurora's gate to the place they once existed as Lovers.  

 And the world reset.

 Now they are an old couple.  The space between the diner booth is as familiar as the closeness shared in bed.  On walks, her fingers always seek his forearm and trace down to his hand which is inevitably shoved into a coat pocket.  She always squeezes his hand three times: I-LOVE-YOU.  Then they look at each other and smile.  

 The waitress takes their breakfast order and refills their coffees.  Sadie is 19 and to her, this couple is old.  Way older than 30.  Older than 40.  50?  Shit, who knows?  Just old.  But nice.  The tall old guy is always reading.  Books, newspapers, notebooks.  But he's always polite and greets everybody with a smile.  His wife is usually staring at her phone.  She ignores everyone unless she has problem with her order and then we all hear it.  She’s old too but still pretty.  Her hair is always perfect and even though she doesn’t wear much makeup, her skin looks good...  

 And the lady looks up from her phone directly at the startled waitress with her wide blue eyes and winks.  Sadie turns away and rushes off to another table.  Well that was weird, she blushes as she approaches a table full of hungry construction workers.

 “Oh quit messing with them” chides the old man without looking up from his book.  The woman laughs and spoons sugar in her coffee.

 Before the volcanos rose from the sea and called themselves islands, all they knew was their love.  This windswept chain of islands in the Pacific northwest became their domain.  Here, the island forests are full of deer, fern and berries.  Craggy cliff tops above a pounding sea are filled with nesting birds.  Bears, raccoons, cougars and foxes follow the cold, clear creeks that tumble down the mountains to the sea.  They wait for spawning salmon or feast on crabs and shellfish.  And the humans discovered these places too.  The leeward bays became fishing villages.  The streams and rivers became routes of trade.  The life force that draws people here unites the sea and rain giving storm clouds in the sky.  

 Or...the man and the woman.  

 Settlers once worshipped the man as Cloud Eagle.  The warrior of thunder and light.  But they feared the woman.  She was the Drowned Hag.  Her staring blue eyes were unknown among the brown-eyed settlers and they feared her gaze and unpredictable temper.  She dwelled deep in watery caves and walked on the bottom of streams and rivers.  The Drowned Hag's nets dragged death and Darkness into her long, white arms.  
The next people to invade and colonize the islands knew the woman as Dancing Fire.  They worshipped the pale goddess and she taught them sacred dances.  The man was regarded more warily.  The Weeping God was a storm god and the fisherfolk worshipped him out of fear.   

 And Belief changed again and again to suit the needs of the islanders that came in waves.  This never bothered them.  They still gave and gathered their essence to every soul birthed on this rocky archipelago.  

 The man and woman loved the world.  They shared it like today’s special at Osprey Bay Cafe.   Steaming, hot coffee, buckwheat pancakes, eggs over easy and elk sausage all for $6.99.  And like many old couples, they enjoy arguing.

 “That fucking zit faced turd boy” says the woman narrowing her eyes at a gawky teenager in a black t-shirt decorated with skulls, ridiculously baggy pants and a wallet chain, “is a thief.  He will steal.”

 “Yeah, they all do”, smiles the man stirring wild honey into his coffee.  “Testing his boundaries.  By their own beliefs, he's not evil.”

 When Sadie turns her back to ring up the bill, the teen nonchalantly slips a KitKat into his pocket.  Then he pulls out his wallet, pays his tab and leaves a dollar on the table as he walks out.  

 “At least he left a tip” chuckles the man.

 “Hmm”, muses the woman dragging her elk sausage through egg yolk before popping it into her mouth, “What if I told you I KNOW he’s evil?  What if I told you before the new moon he will kill an innocent?”

 “There is no more evil my love.  They simply don’t care.”

 “So you say, yet a girl will die.  By HIS actions!  His father's lawyer will save him from jail and he will go to a junior college in California.  The girl will sleep beneath our cold earth in a pink casket lined with teddy bears and roses”.

 “Oh?” nods the man without concern.  “I suppose that would be a victory for you.  Well, maybe in the old days.”

 “Trace his thread!” demands the woman.  “The soul is mine.”

 The old man sighs, puts down his book and smiles at his wife.  Even today, her old fierce self burns through.  This woman has never backed down from anything.    

 “In the old days you would be right dear.  He kills the girl.  Blood for blood, life for life.  But now we know he drinks the beer for you.  Rebellion.  Like stealing candy.  Seven beers and vodka causes the crash.  The girl dies an innocent.  He drinks because he is young and foolish.  This soul is mine woman.”

 The electricity in the cafe flickers as the woman stares malevolently at him.  He drowns in her wide blue eyes.  Helpless, all he can do is grin at her and wait.  Powerless as always in her spell.  After all these years, she is still so fucking beautiful, he muses.  Too beautiful for the likes of him but maybe that is why she puts up with his nonsense.  No matter what happens in their lives, his soul is always a prisoner in her eyes.

 And primal energy streams through each patron as they question their existence.  For an awkward moment, everyone becomes misty eyed and longs for their secret love.  The love that calls to them louder than all other loves.  Some are lucky and have this person in their life but most are not.  They stare at their companions like strangers and question reality for a mad moment...And then the flickering lights stop.  The spell is broken and they go back to their breakfasts.  

 The woman smiles the same smile that has greeted the man at dawn for thousands of years.  

 “Times have changed” she says.  “But someday Empty Wolf, you will know I’m right.”

 “Empty Wolf?”, laughs the man, “The Eternal Devourer of Men heheh....Why no one has called me that for 6 generations.  And my dear, you are ALWAYS right.”

 “They don’t believe in justice anymore”, sighs the woman.

 “Well not your justice.  And I agree in principal.  His head should decorate a pole and stare at the sunset until the gulls peck it clean.  But in this age, the little shit wins.  So do I.”

 The woman smiles.  The eternal argument.  

 “Ok.  Let’s go.  Let’s get ice cream at Stanley’s Sweets and walk to my sea.”

 “You mean my sea”, corrects the man.  “Before the last curtain of Darkness, the last folks to come through believed my tears created the sea.  Remember?”

 “Yeah whatever.  It was mine before yours.  I was the White Seal who brought fishermen safely to shore.”

 “And the Sea Hag,” reminds the man as they walk out into a frozen February.  

 Hand in hand, they approach the lookout.  She eats a double scoop waffle cone with chocolate banana fudge and strawberry.  He eats a peanut butter chocolate chip brownie.  The lookout spans across a bay where whales wander.  The cliffs hunched over the sea were places of worship and sacrifice to the old couple who munched on their sweets and watch seagulls wheel high above the sea.  The kid from the diner sits on a bench staring out over the ocean as well.  Faint traces of marijuana linger in the air from his pipe.

 The teen stares across the water while enjoying his stolen candy bar.  A gull cries out and the teen is confused as the ocean suddenly grows still and flat.  The waves stop.  A wide, green square of ocean lies motionless like an emerald tile before him.  

Whoa, thinks the teen.  Trippy.

 Stoned and silly, he feels Them.  He turns around but no one is there.  Above the smooth, green sea floats a cloud.  Kinda looks like a wolf, thinks the teen as he finishes his KitKat and throws the wrapper into the sea.

Like most of you, I've lied, I've cheated, I've stolen, I've isolated, I've burned bridges, I've even given up love all for this shitty substance that gets me high.

Right now, at this point in my life, I am utterly alone. My family says they love me, but I can hear the tone in their voices when they speak to me. I am nothing but a disappointment to them and a burden. My own brother fucking hates me. He doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore. When we were growing up, I used to be his hero. Once on my birthday he gave me a superman shirt because to him I was superman. But now he doesn't even look me in the eye. (Fuck, now I'm crying as I type this.)

The funny thing about it is that I've tried to clean up the mess I've made of myself. I've gone to rehab with sincere intentions of getting clean. Hell, I've been twice now. And to be completely honest, I am much better for it. Since the 1st time, I haven't stolen or cheated, I haven't traded love, I haven't isolated or manipulated. I have lied though - solely about my use however. And even though I look at myself now and realize that I am much better of a person than I used to be, my family still sees me as the junky. They still see me as this god-forsaken soul and they want nothing to do with me. 

I have no friends anymore. I guess I gave them up when I began my journey down this path in the beginning. The strange thing is I never once stole from them, or cheated them - they just stopped loving me because I began loving the dope. I wish more than anything I still had them around. That I still had someone to cry to instead of crying to the internet. I wish someone was here with me now as I contemplate my life and its meaning. Maybe I wouldn't feel so worthless then.

It's strange. The one thing that caused all of this is the one thing that makes it better. I can think about killing myself all damn day, but the moment the needle flags red and the plunger has been pushed to 0, it all goes away. As I slip into the nod and my consciousness shifts, I no longer care about whether or not I'm actually alive or dead - I am set free from all the nonsense. 

This is so fucking sick, but sometimes I feel as if my life has no purpose without heroin. Why the fuck is that? How can someone feel that way?

I wish my brother would tell me he loves me. I wish my mom would  stop accusing me of stealing her stuff - because I honestly haven't stolen anything since before my first trip to rehab many moons ago. I wish my dad was proud of me. I wish my grandpa and grandma would see me as an equal. I wish my aunts and uncles wouldn't whisper as I walk by. 

I think the reason I'm posting this is because it's getting real hard for me to carry all these thoughts around inside me. I think that I'm hoping someone out there will read this and say ""Hey man, keep your chin up. Everything is going to be alright."" Even if everything isn't going to be alright. I think I'm just hoping someone out there will see this and just nod their head and tell me they know how I feel and put their arm around me. ",1444710861.0

I only have 20 5mg pills left (and have eaten about 9 over the course of 3 days).  

I respect the danger of the drug.  I respect and appreciate the advice everyone is giving me.  

However, I'm very curious how ""life just finds a way"" to get me more pills.

I'm not asking for details, neighborhoods, etc. to find more.  I'm just curious as to ways they may find me that I'm not thinking of.

I also don't know how to use bitcoin and don't trust Tor, nor know who to navigate the deep web.

So, how did your addiction start?  After you found your 1st bottle of pills, how did you score your 2nd?

 Skip ahead and read the 2 bracketed off paragraphs for the main ideas. 

           So I tried searching for this and surprised to not see anything. The idea just came to me the other day when I read for the 100th time about how methadone is often very gradually tapered off ml by ml. Then I figured why not do the same thing. 

           I was on subs for a month previously before returning to dope. I had no I tension of quiting for good. I need to get on subs for one I was leaving the country on a cruise stopping only in Bermuda. Literally one of the worst places to find drugs. I heard its mostly dry and when you do find something its 200 a gram of coke and 40 a gram for dirt weed. (Weel that's the rumor and makes sense since there in the middle of no where even beer is double the price). Also I needed to get a job once I got through both of those I went to the dr one more time just to get a stock pile before relapsing later that day. 

            So now I have a months worth of subs 30s days. I actually realized I kinda enjoyed bring sober. Well at least for a little I may try for real until I save up some money and move out of my parents house. (Just graduated college in May with a okay science job at 20/hr). 

-----END OF THE BACKROUND INFORNATION -----

-----------NOW TO THE IMPORTANT PART ----------

I want to know what people think or if anyone has done this idea before or know someone who has. I only have 8mg subs so I know at the end this becomes difficult to taper off and get to a low dose some an 1/8 a strip is 1mg still a hard point to jump off at. I plan to. I have a strong habit so I will taper down normally with 1 sub/day until I get to about 1/4 of a sub. 

THIS IS THE DIFFERENT PART- I plan on dissolving my 8mg sub into 80mg of water and basically dropping down my daily doseage by about 1ml every day. I figure this will be small enough to not notice. Towards the end I will slow down and maybe dissolve a 8mg sub into 160ml and drop a ml a day once I an at about 1mg a day since this amount is so small. That way I'll be taking 20 days to get off 1mg but who cares cause in the process I'll only be using 2 subs at the most. 

-------------AND MORE DETAILS FEEL FREE TO READ BUT MAINLY I NEED HELP WITH THOSE 2 PARAGRAPHS. --------------

(but reading may help give better advice which is why I put them in.)

           Yes this will take a very long time but part of that is the goal to stay on subs to help with cravings.

Every move I made for the next 5 hours or so made me vomit, I couldn't even turn my head without having the urge to puke. Was this an od? I didn't black out but I obviously had too much, so much that I've decided I'm no longer going to indulge in opiates or else I just might kill myself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I have been using heroin for almost a full ten years, 8 of which was all IV. My parents have known about my struggle for almost that entire time about 8 years. They have paid for 4 rehabs/detoxes up til the present. Have run the gamete from state funded shitty ass 30 day inpatient, 10 day hospital detox, 60 day luxury resort rehab (the only way to withdraw if you can afford the $40k/month), have done soboxone through my PCP twice and was actually paid to take it while participating in the first human clinical trials for it in 2004 at Columbia University, none of which worked for longer than 3 months. My longest ""clean"" time was the 8 months I spent volunteering in South America, I used quotes because I wasn't IVing dope, but did still use codiene and tramadol on a 3 day on/3 day off cycle so as not to deal with WDs. I also banged tons of 95% pure peruvian flake at $3/gram but I digress.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had run out of options save for the one I had put off for a decade, methadone. Now I had done strett 'done a handful of times as well as two of the detoxes had been methadone tapers. What concerns me about it is that no matter how big your habit was you always were given 40mgs and had 5mgs less every day til 0 for the 'done taper. In a clinic the recommended dosage is 80-120mgs!! Just rediculous, but I was sick of getting arrested losing jobs and apartments and letting down my family so I had finally agreed to go to a clinic when I thought I would thow a hail mary because why not, it's 14-20, 3rd down, 0:09 s left and we're only at OUR 20yrd line. I brought up Ibogaine, I didn't think they would go for it seeing as it is a psychedelic, Schedule I in our country has has known neurotoxicity.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well they weren't as instantly offput as I assumed to after a great deal of discussing about pharmacology, the rediculous US drug policy and how much sway the pharmacuetical companies have in congress they said they would pay for me to do it. But only in Canada, they didn't trust Mexico and couldn't afford to send me to the UK, Sweden or Amsterdam.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a ton of research I found the most legit one out there, libertyroot in Vancouver pricetag, ~$7000 USD for a 10 day stay. Way cheaper than all but the shittiest state run rehabs I had been too. Now here is where they really have my back, for Ibogaine to be most effective yoiu should be in minor opiate WD so you can have the profound experience necessary to remind yourself how serious this is and to never experience it again. Since libertyroot didn't have an opening for a month and I had moved away from my apt in a major heroin soaked city and into my parents house in the middle of nowhere where dope was $30 a bag and stepped on 5 times if you could even find it. I convinced them truthfully that I need to be on something to maintain until I could go to BC. Once I had thoroughly convinced them of this necessity the question became what to get.  
&nbsp; Well first thing first they called up their close friend who has had brain surgery 5 times to prevent aneurysms who had pain pills left over. So came out with 30 5/500 mg vicoden, 20 7.5/750 vicoden and 40 super old Darvacet 100 (100 mg proproxyphene/300 mg APAP). Telling them my tolerance level we decided on 40 mgs in the morning and at night. Even with my tolerance it's hard to convine your parents that you need 8 pills at a time, twice a day just to feel normal, but after they saw that my pupils barely even moved after the first 40mgs they believed me. SO the pills were great buit wouldn't last a month so they paid for 20 lbs of poppy seeds for me from Amazon and 10 grams of tianeptine.   
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I told my mom all about the chemistry and pharmacology and she even helped me make the tea. I go to libertyroot in 15 more days and just ordered more seeds, I am so lucky to have understanding parents who only want the best for me. They know none of my actions were malicious and were solely motivated by abnormal brain chemistry and poor choices to mask emotional pain. I love them and can't wait for them to see me sober and happy for years to come.

I was lucky enough to land my dream job after living out of my car and couch surfing for a while. With how quickly they needed to hire someone on, I did not have enough time see a doctor or get into a program. I'm actually typing this up on my lunch break orientation. 

So I did my last shot this morning which was moderately small. I currently have about 10 1mg Alprazolam, 14mg yellow bars, 4 8mg Sub strips and 2x 140mls liquid methadone. 

I have been able to detox myself pretty comfortable with 20 10mg methadone, some good ganja, and some xannies and gabapentin to help out. So right now I have everything I need except the 10mg dones but I do have the liquid. 

My main question is, is 10mls of the of the liquid comparable to 1 10mg methadone pill? If that's the case I should be okay. But if not, what should o do?

Today is only Monday so I have to figure out a way to make it through the next week. Any and all suggestions any of you would have would be immensely appreciated. Thanks in advance bropiates!!",1444678442.0

3oh9mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3oh9mz/the_wedding_and_the_coke_dealer/,13,https://redd.it/3oh9mz,HisDelvistSelf,The wedding and the coke dealer,"I wasn't going to make a post about this, but apparently people find it almost as amusing as I, so what the hell.

Last night I went to my GF's sister's wedding. I knew almost no one there, just my GF's immediate family. It was a late evening, outdoor affair at an aunt's estate by a lake. There was a cash bar, and open use of marijuana, but I abstained as I've been clean for just over 5 months.

So, skip to just after the ceremony, pictures of groomsmen, bridesmaids, etc have just been completed. I mozie over to the group of people including my girlfriend, and as I get there, a man (we'll call him Julius) takes over the conversation. He announces that he has a few pounds of weed, a bag of shooms, and some amount of coke that he brought for the party. Meanwhile he's passing around what he claims is a Cuban, I had my doubts but I wouldn't know.

He offers his wares to my girlfriend and I. We both politely decline, and walk away. I'm told that after we left, her sister informed Julius that I had a problem with heroin and meth, and had been clean for a few months.

So my girlfriend and I go on about the wedding, the cake, the ham, the dancing, nearly dying in a ball of fire. You know, typical wedding stuff. Both of us are having a nice time.

Skip again to about 8:30. I guess there had been a car accident and a resulting power outage to the entire Valley (~200,000 people). We didn't care, we had a bonfire and candles. I had to use the bathroom. As I emerge, Julius is once again talking with my girlfriend, although now he is obviously fucked up. She is noticeably uncomfortable with the conversation. As I get nearer, I hear that he is insisting ""well if /u/hisdelvistself used, then you must too."" She awkwardly told him no, but he kept pushing. As I get there, I try to shift the conversation on to me. He congratulates my sobriety, and follows it up by informing me ""you know, I'm big time. If I want things done, if someone is bothering me, I bring my boys and handle things."" Ok. Cool. 

""I used to run with those crowds too, I knew that world, but not anymore."" I say.

""Hey, if you wanna bring your guys, I'll bring my guys, we'll see who comes out alive""

Woah. Is he kidding?

I was done talking to him, wigged out on coke, whiskey, shrooms, and weed. I start to leave but he says something to my girlfriend, I don't remember what, to get us back over. As I turn, he grabs me by my suspenders (it was a 1920s theme) and begins his best Fear and Loathing impression.

""I don't like you. You talk to much, and you look funny. See how I have you? See how I've got your hands and your suspenders? You're mine!"" 

The people close enough to see what was happening stopped their conversation. Was he playing around? Was he serious? I have been in fights before, few but yes. I honestly couldn't tell if he was seriously pissed or what. So my only reaction was to test his claim that I was stuck. I pulled my hands away and started to push him away...

SMACK he lands one under my jaw.

Now everyone was silent. I was shocked enough that all I did was step back, and by that time some fellas at the bar pulled him and I apart.

OK, so the junkie and the geek had a little bitch struggle, no big deal.

However, as we were leaving (girlfriend was balling, she thought I was dying), Julius runs over to me and slaps me on the back. He puts his arm over my shoulder and around my neck, like buddies might do. Except, he wasn't being friendly. He was slowly increasing pressure so I had trouble breathing.

What proceeded from his mouth was half apology, half threat. He says ""Hey man, I'm sorry about back there. I have a tendency to snap, and when I snap, there's no telling what I'll do. See, I'm dangerous, and people just have to be careful around me, I'm fucked up. So hey, be safe man.""

So, that's my story. I know he was just spaced the fucked out, but I think he honestly intended to threaten me. Oh well. 

TLDR- Coke dealer was tripping, hit me, and made veiled threats as I left the wedding. ",1444673149.0

bonus question- what about pharmacies? does anyone know if there are any pharmacies close enough to the resorts to take a taxi to..? i'd love to get my hands on some benzos & ket while there. i also wouldn't mind finding some opi's at the pharmacy if i can't score dope anywhere. thanks in advance for any answers/tips.",1444814763.0

I've read plenty of quit lit pertaining to the latter, and the author in question always thinks they've stumbled onto a nugget of self-evident genius when they espouse that cigarettes create cravings for more cigarettes—you want one because you have a physiological addiction, not independently. The feeling of relaxation from a cigarette is created by the very cigarettes your body now demands.

To me, that is the most beautiful part. When non-smokers try to tell me this, I ask them if they have something in their life that can cheer them up without fail. I say, ""Sure, you've got your favorite music or a funny TV show or maybe you like to talk it out, but does it work 100% of the time?"" And they always pause and say, ""no.""

That's the feeling I'm addicted to. The control and ability to improve my mood whenever I want, no matter what. That power is so important for somebody who has often felt helpless and struggled with depression. I think it may be an underlying reason for a lot of the things we do as humans. Food addictions, gambling—hell, I was addicted to gum for a couple of years. Yeah, chewing gum. 

The mind is an amazing and dangerous thing. If only we could isolate and form these Pavlovian associations of mood improvement with something positive.

I am two weeks away from losing any chance I had at getting into grad school and getting the career I've been working for almost 6 years now. I have no money for applications (over 600$) No I'm not asking for money. I can't control my dope habit. I have been middle manning just to get by. I was originally using oxys for awhile, and then this girl who I'm really into got me into dope. 
             I was helping her get it, because I care about her well being and would rather me drive her to my dude who I trust and not have her go to the ghetto. I never got dope from him before, and I've known him for years up until she convinced me to try it because it's way cheaper than oxys. I work a shitty paying job that gets me experience for grad school, and I've been fucking up with it due to having to pick up in the morning prior so I'm not sick.
           I met a girl when I first moved back home from college, and at first it was just a fling. She's engaged so I didn't expect much. She had a bad habit years ago, and she started doing oxys with me shortly after we met. We hang out everyday all day until she has to go home to her fiancé, and I sit alone in the dark. I was homeless for about 6 months, and she was always there for me with food and gas while I was sleeping in my car. My pops is letting me crash until I get on my feet (which he doesn't really want me there, my brother had to practically beg him). He doesn't know about my habit, he just doesn't want anything to do with his kids anymore.
            I attempted suicide several weeks ago via drinking a cocktail of bleach and ammonia before work, and the paramedics got to me shortly after I went unconscious. I am so fucking sad. I came back home, and since I quit smoking weed, all of my homeboys, (whom stuck up for me and got charges for beating up a kid and his brother after this kid jumped me with his friends) completely abandoned me. Everyone in my family abandoned me, and doesn't want to deal with my problems. I uber on the side and personal train for money, but it all goes to dope, and I can't stop. I'm under my dad's insurance (he's a doctor) so I can't go to a sub/meth clinic. 
      Bottom line, my life went from being aspiring and hopeful to a screeching halt. Nobody gives a fuck about me anymore, all my die-hard homeboys abandoned me who I thought were there thick and thin. Noone knows about my habit so it's not because of that. The only person who gives a flying fuck about me is this girl, and she goes home every night and sleeps with her man who neglects her and treats her like crap most of the time.
        We're really good friends (her and I not the fiancé), and I'm really happy to have her in my life, and she genuinely cares about me, but I just can't help but feel so lost and so fucking alone in this world. I know many of you have it worse than me, and I should be grateful for what I have, but I am just so damn depressed and am struggling to have food, money, dope, happiness, gas, and a roof over my head. I've gotten suicide somewhat  out of my mind after I saw how upset she got. I would never want to hurt her by killing myself, and some days it is really, really, really hard to get it out of my head. 
             I'm at the end of my wits. I can't expect anything between her and I besides friendship, and I wish I could just jump 4 years into the future with my career on track. I love the time I have with her, we pick up together get high together, and really look out for one another, but when the sun goes down, I'm back to where I feel like I've always been in this world; cold, dark, abandoned, and alone. 
           Someone please throw some decent advice my way, and don't be mean. I'm a nice kid, and I don't mean to cause problems or harm towards anyone who doesn't deserve it.",1444801318.0

4. Staying hydrated and nourished the whole time

How bad will this be compared to a straight up detox? I have been failing at my detoxes lately because I'm getting weaker. Can't even taper anymore, I just give in. I'm telling myself this will physically feel better. I have Thursday PM to Monday PM to myself. Hoping to get the bulk of it out of the way before going back to work.

Thanks for any advice! Really anything helps. These days I can't even find reason to quit. I used to get so determined and go through detoxes and live a meaningful life for months and months. Right now I'm so down that if I don't stop soon, I won't be able to stop for a while.

If I Died Today

If I died today, I hope you forgive me.
I hope you live and breathe and understand, sometimes things are not what they're meant to be.
I hope you remember, fondly, all the times I told you how much I loved you and how much you meant to me.
I hope you learn to let go of all the little things that sometimes came in between us.
I hope your heart stays strong and I hope your heart refuses to break. 
If I died today, I would want to be buried in the cemetery where, one day, you would join me.
Even when I was angry with you and even when you were angry with me, I want you to know, how close you always were to me.
You told me, once, at night, when you lay your head down, you say goodnight to me, even when I'm not there.
I hope you'd still say goodnight to me, even if I died today, and I hope I'd hear your voice, from worlds so far away.
You gave me so much and I took so much from you and I wish I had a way to return all the big things and I wish I had a way to mend all the big hurts and unhappy things I caused. If I died today, I hope you don't shed any tears for my soul. If I died today, I hope you live much longer. If I died today, I hope your heart rests in peace. If I died today, I want you to know, I know that you're the person I will truly hurt the most. I hope that whatever happens, today, I hope that I don't die today, but if I do, I want you to know, that if I had more time to talk to you, or explain anything, these are the things I would want to say. I love you very much and I am so glad I lived a life with you in it, and I am so glad I always had you to tell me that I was your sunshine and think of me as you laid down in bed at night and tell me goodnight even when I wasn't there.
Thank you for giving me more chances than I deserved and trusting me even when you knew I wasn't honest and when I was telling you everything but the truth. Thank you for standing up for me when I didn't stand a chance and thank you for refusing to give up on me even when I know you were tired of trying and wanted to quit.
If I died today, I hope you still love me, and I hope you forgive me, and I hope you understand.
If I died today, I want you to know how much I love you, and how thankful I am that I lived in a lifetime where I was lucky enough to have you in it. If I died today, I want you to know, I'd be happy to go, and I love you, so very much, and I am so glad, that in a lifetime when I had absolutely nothing, I had someone like you to call my mother.
I'm so happy that you were my mom.",1444787260.0

Looking for advice from anyone with experience.,"I'm coming from a daily habit that alternated between H and PST. About an hour ago I took slightly less than a quarter of a 50mg naltrexone pill, I'm guessing was somewhere near 9-10mg. 

I feel absolutely awful. Worse than any withdrawal I've ever felt. I've been trying to type the for past 30 minutes, but I've had to run to the bathroom to projectile vomit or have terrible diarrhea (sry) every 5 minutes or so.

I'm starting to get worried about dehydration because I can't keep any liquids down and I'm emptying fluids on the toilet rapidly. Also sweating profusely.

Will anything put an end to this madness? Anything I can take with a higher binding affinity than naltrexone? Anyone gone the same thing ?

Reason I took naltrexone is because I've been trying to kick for a while and I keep telling myself I'm going to. But once the withdrawals appear, I tell myself I'll end it just one more day. It's an endless cycle so I decided to take the naltrexone to jumpstart withdrawals and prevent future dosing. Thought I was using a low enough dose of avoid this, but apparently not.

Any advise is welcome and appreciated.

3ore9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3ore9x/benzo_help_dr_questions/,7,https://redd.it/3ore9x,crushstickahhh,"Benzo help, Dr questions","so I have recently been put on alprazolam if any of you guys have been following my posts. I also get a unicorn Dilaudid script every month and just recently (last sunday) tried H for the first time due to running out of my script early. 

However before I did that H I was using the alprazolam to try to ease my somewhat mild withdrawals (I have beeen through dilly wd's dozens and dozens and dozens of times), so I have honestly gotten used to it. The alprazolam did help ut Im supposed to be taking for its actual intended use, for that it doesnt woro so great. I was put on tow .25mg pills a day, and from what the Dr told me this is the lowest starting dose. 

So If I call her office back (its been a litttle over a week) and tell her that its not working, I still cant sleep etc...what should I expect? is that a red fla with benzos? (i have never really been on them) or will she just up my dosage, or is there something else she will put me on? or is there something better that I should request that might work out better and also be recreational?

**funny story**
My only experience with drugs has been with pharms, due to a medical condition(s) that has plagued me since I was seven. However recently things got screwy at my PM place and my monthly script ran out way too fast. I dont know anyone who uses, and no one knows that I do, but finding a connect wasnt that hard ;p, and I found an AWESOME one. So I guess I have never really experienced nodding before. There was this one time in the hospital where I managed to squeeze some fent out of my fent patch and mix it w a 5ml saline syringe they left in my room. I injected that and woke up 2 hours later with the 5ml syringe still screwed onto my port, man did I get lucky....

However sunday when I tried H for the first time I went mild and did half a bag. Im used to the dilly rush, and have injected as much as 80mg in one day. I never really nodded, just fell asleep and woke up. So I set up everything. I put The Gambler in my xbox one and let the previews start playing, that way once im done with the shot it will be within he first 5 min of the movie, and I can hear the audio from my bathroom . I lay out some= doritos, salted cashews, cranberry sprite (holy shit is this new stuff awesome, and I dont drink a lot of soda, esp sprite haha). So I do the shot and then figure ill get a shit out of the way. So Im browsing gawker, tmz, gizmodo, kotaku etc..dropping kids here and there. I eventually flush the toilet and hed to my man cave to watch the rest of my movie....The fucking movie is over.....Serious, its in the last 15 min of the god damn movie. I feel like I was awake the whole time, but I also remember like dropping my phone like 13 times, bo jokqwwwqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Using Heroin while on these stimulants.,"I do not have ADHD/ADD and I am not prescribed Adderall or Vyvanse but I take it up to 4 times a week usually to help with my studies, alleviate withdrawal symptoms and catch a nice speedy buzz. My usual dose is 30mgXR Adderall or 60-70mg Vyvanse. I also use Heroin 2-4 days of the week (mini binges) and experience minor flu like withdrawals on the off days. I have been using Heroin (on/off) for a year now and started experiencing minor WDs 4 months ago. The past month or two I have been taking Adderal/Vyvanse on all of my off days (withdrawal days). I find that speeding really helps alleviate my withdrawal symptoms. It specifically helps with chills, body pain, mental fogginess and especially sniffles/congestion which is a major symptom for me. Sometimes when I am able to, I use Heroin while I am on Adderall/Vyvanse. If I have a good amount of dope I will use  throughout the day which alleviates withdrawals and gives me a nice mini speedball like buzz. If I am running low or only picked up a 20 I will save it for come down. The H is high quality hard chunky carmel/tan coloured ECP. I never do a large amount at once as I am not a major fan of nodding (although it is nice at times). My usual ROA is snorting small lines until I feel content. From time to time I will shoot up but I try to keep slamming to a minimum. I have shot up while speeding before but I kept the dosage low. The only negative side effect I experience with this combo is a rise in body temperature, I just feel hotter than usual but it is nowhere near overwhelming. Does any one else use Adderall, Vyvanse or other prescription stimulants on their off/on days and if so does it help with your WD symptoms? What is your preference/combination when mixing these drugs? Also this may sound dumb but how dangerous/unhealthy is it to take uppers while suffering minor withdrawals and how dangerous/unhealthy is it to do Heroin while on these stimulants? ",1444849069.0
