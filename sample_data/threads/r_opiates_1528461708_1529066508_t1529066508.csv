Going to go ahead and stay as I did multiple times in this, that I accept responsibility for my addiction. However, I would like to tell my story to anybody that is willing to listen. Thanks in advance if you read all of this, and thanks for any replies within sight or personal experiences with us as well. I highly encourage other chronic pain sufferers to use their voice, share their experience, and fight against this shit because if we don't nobody is going to go. Apologize for all the f-bombs in this, I'm pretty heated about this topic. Anyways, enjoy my story, or at least take something out of it.

---

Want to make a separate comment on here about how this affects me, I think it's critical for us pain patients to speak out. I'll try to keep it brief. After being mangled as a pedestrian hit by a car, I will have chronic pain in my leg for the rest of my life. I have massive Hardware in my leg, rod in my femur was multiple screws in my hip and knee. I was study on a low script for 6 years just fine, suddenly lost my script for 10 mg oxy without having done anything wrong, I wasn't abusing it I just could not afford an MRI uninsured that a new guideline required me to have to continue being prescribed it.

Not at all blaming anyone else for my addiction, but I must say that I never once bought a pill on the street during those 6 years. What did happen though, was me going to the streets and mediately after losing that script. When pills got expensive 6 months later I was using heroin. And the two years since I have absolutely destroyed my entire life. I want from someone who was unfortunately hit by a car at 16 and stuck with a lifetime of some pretty rough pain, so now someone who also has that same chronic pain but is additionally ifucking heroin addict on top of it.

What is going on with pain patients and their scripts is complete and utter bullshit.
- People on scripts for years, even older riddled with arthritis and a stack of things wrong causing them pain, are fearing being cut off, likely without even as much of the taper, and they the day is going to happen.
- People are being pushed to Suboxone for pain management, when the reality is that it doesn't help everybody's pain and I do experience a pretty noticeable decrease in pain control by using that for paying since I am in recovery for my addiction now. 
- 7-Day scripts are not going to help anyone, and are truly ridiculous for anybody that's not post-op or a temporary injury that will heal, people that are going to be prescribed long-term should be prescribed on a 30-day basis. Sure, hold people accountable, drug test pill count whatever. But limiting the script so drastically is so detrimental. Going from pill Mills insane High unnecessary oxy scripts to anybody that says their back hurts, to ibuprofen and being told to stretch when you have documented proof of legitimate pain, is not the answer.

Pain patients are becoming criminals, risking felonies to supplement their lost script when they turn to the streets. Pain patients still need to go to work functioning when they are aching and withdrawing following their inevitable off from their medication. Soccer moms are out there buying pills in the hood, people with low tolerance is that are buying illicitly are having to worry dying from a fentanyl or random research chemical press when it would be avoided altogether if they could just get a goddamn script, pain patients that never even abused their scripts are being treated like junkie scum. Chronic pain is debilitating, chronic pain has made me suicidal. People should not be contemplating suicide seriously because they are in such severe untreated paying, I have seen more than one post on here and the chronic pain sell about people wanting to end their life because they hurt so bad.

I can think of a handful of solutions that would solve much of this, but it seems like the ignorant people that are in charge of it I have no idea what they're doing. Hey, maybe a requirement to be in charge of this shit should be having chronic pain. Because clearly everyone's ignorant, lacking compassion, and seems to want people jumping from the doctor's office to shooting dope over untreated pain...

 1. If they are going two limits scripts like this and push pain patients on Suboxone, let people get methadone easier as well. Allow Kratom to be a thing as it keeps a lot of people's pain and check without having to escalate to harder things. You can walk into a Clinic being a heroin addict and get a high dose of methadone that would absolutely kill pain. But yet it's much harder to get it prescribed for pain... Why? As an addict I have full compassion for other items, however it's somehow easier for drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair, drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair at all.

 2. Cut that 7-Day script bullshit for chronic pain 

3. Let primary care doctors continue treating moderate pain, ultimately though just let doctors be fucking doctors and not refuse to prescribe and fear of their DEA license. 

4. Stop continuously decreasing the amount that doctors can write, and insurance companies need to stop suddenly refusing to cover more than a certain morphine equivalents in a script. Bust the doctors that are actually abusing their power and wrongly over prescribing opiates script, let the others be and treat their damn patience the way that they see fit as... A doctor! 

5. This isn't something that government would do, but still something that would help all this... Pain management clinics need to cut the cash-only bullshit some of them do, and methadone and Suboxone need to be more easily accessible as it would help pain patients and also addicts as well. 

6. People need to drop a goddamn stigma around people taking opiates for pain! It's totally possible to use it as prescribed and not be a junkie, and stop shiting on the people that have fallen into addiction after pain issues. Thing of simultaneous pain patient and raging addict has made me want to kill myself at times because it is such a goddamn miserable existence . Stop telling people with debilitating pain to suck it up, stop being so uncompassionate, trust me if Tylenol worth we would fucking take it. I would love a normal life. 

7. And for those that r a simultaneous addict and being patient like myself, like I stated above, which is a more and more common story these days the current state of this shit... Make methadone the remedy for this if Suboxone doesn't work. People seem to develop the belief that if you form an addiction you don't deserve pain control and should suffer, no... That's bullshit. I'm an addict, and my pain is still real and valid. I deserve treatment, I don't deserve to be shit on for something I didn't ask for. I didn't ask to be injured, I didn't ask to lose a script that I was studying on for 6 God damn years.

That about concludes my rant I guess. This whole thing is fucked. I'm bitter at ruining my life ending up on heroin immediately following losing a script, it's bullshiter it's not fair. I'm better at the what ifs, I'm bitter thinking that this probably wouldn't have been My outcome  otherwise. I'm bitter that I wasn't abusing my script, and lost it without warning. I'm better that I have fucking shot up heroin because of the progression of events. I get to enjoy life of chronic pain and being an addict. It's miserable,  and I'm determined to use every breath I have to use my voice  to speak out on this and to help pain patients, addicts, those are both etcetera.  Too many people are  stigmatizing  these groups. At the end of the day, I'm still just a God damn person beneath my addiction and a person that just doesn't want to hurt anymore. A person that is considered suicide to make it stop, on multiple occasions. 


TL DR, nobody gives a fuck about pain patients when implementing these policies.  Pain patients are turning into criminals. Pain patient  with no record are catching felonies buying their medication on the streets. Pain patients are using heroin. Pain patients are becoming suicidal over such debilitating pain. Pain patients are not always addicts. But if they are addicts, they still deserve relieved! Pain patients should not have to fight for a script for Percocet with extensive documented damage to their body. Pain patients being prescribed opioids are not why there is an epidemic! Pain patients are not responsible for past over prescribing. Pain patients deserve options to feel normal. Pain patients wish that non narcotics and injections would work. Pain patients are tired. Pain patients are being neglected. Pain patients are using fucking heroin and it should not be happening ever due to a lost script by someone not even abusing it!!! I repeat, pain patients are using fucking heroin  to treat their pain. Pain patients are your parents, your grandparents, your peers, or you someday. Pain patients that are young still have pain that is just as valid and should not be dismissed for their age. Pain patients are not often just drug Seekers.. Pain patients don't deserve to be treated like junkie scum for treating their pain with opioids. Pain patients shouldn't be told to suck it up, ever. Pain patients for the most part did not ask for their pain! Pain patients are not the ones crying wolf begging for stronger and stronger meds. Pain patients are overdosing and dying. Pain patients are risking coming into contact with fentanyl. Pain patients just want a normal quality of life, want to be able to work play with their kids enjoy their free time Etc. But instead leave doctor's appointments in tears with their pain untreated, invalidated, and driving them insane. If you have not experienced chronic pain, please have compassion for those who do deal with it. And please do not try do finesse an opiate script when you don't need one, every post on here that's ever been made asking for tips in the ER or the doctor took score a script takes away from people who really need it and it's bullshit. I truly want to punch every motherfuker in the face that fake pain to any extent trying to score opioids, it's an insult two people that never asked for pain and never asked you truly need these drugs. Thanks to anyone that's listen, and to those that are hurting along with me I hope you have a day of minimal pain and please feel free to message me anytime to connect to someone else who gets it.",1529064763.0

](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8q6byk/im_checking_into_the_hospital_tonight/)

I went to one hospital which referred me to another. I was completely suicidal and verbalized this to both hospitals. The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.

I was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. 

Some 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.

I got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.

They decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early & I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.

Now here I am 

4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.

Anyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain. I'm hoping that subsides soon.",1529057107.0

My method, in hindsight and through testing, doesn't work and it involved mixing the ""powder"" (read:beads) with baking soda and melting it together in a toaster oven on something metal and then throwing it in the freezer to stop the heating . Then I would scrape it up and snort it.

Well firstly, baking soda burns like the devils taint up your nose. Secondly, it still takes a good while for it to work.

The new method I just discovered involves using alcohol as a solvent and sugar as a medium for solidification of sorts. I made a small pile out of a 36mg Xtampza capsule on an aluminum plate (the side of a vaping mod). I added drop after drop of tequila until the whole pile was thoroughly wetted and was starting to run. Using a small coffee straw I mixed the booze and the XT together until it seemed to be dissolved. Then I added a pinch of white sugar to it to collect it all and stop it from running all over the place. Then I heated it in the toaster oven until it swelled up and bubbled slightly.

Immediately I put it in the freezer to stop the heating process and to solidify the goop. This method didn't give me a pile of material that I could snort unfortunately so I scraped it all up and ate and chased it down with some soda.

The alcohol/heating definitely broke it down as it wasn't granular hardly at all AND it tasted pretty f-ing good. More importantly, within 25 mins I was fucking high as if I ate 40mgs of oxy IR. Normally with Xtampza you have to wait at least and hour to feel it fully.

\*\* TL;DR: Mix Xtamza powder and alcohol until dissolved, add sugar and heat in oven until bubbly, freeze for 10 seconds, remove and eat. \*\*

Fucked up in T+25mins.

Hope it works for you all. Im sure there's a better medium than sugar that might result in a crushable/snortable final product. I just don't know what that might be.....corn starch?",1529053543.0

I was sweating, shaking, pacing the rooms of my home looking for some sort of relief. This was a pain that struck a familiar nerve and I remembered experiencinging it a decade ago. Mother fucking kidney stone pain and it seemed way more intense than last time.

Yet I was very reluctant to stroll to my local emergency department. See the first time I had stones many years ago I was into drugs, but hadn't yet scared my arms with thousands of needle stabs. When I went to the ER that time it was Dilaudid buffet, with the nurse proclaiming during my discharge, ""Oh, you've still got another shot (my 3rd) on your precription, want it for the road?"" Fuck yeah I said, and by the time I got home 5 minutes down the road I projectile vomited everywhere. I was having a blast.

In between then and the present I had totally fucked my life by jumping on dope and banging, leaving obvious marks in the crooks of my arm. It has been a few years since I got clean and got my life on track but the marks are obvious and the health care junkie radar has been hyped to NORAD proportions. I was not hopeful my ER visit would result in easing my pain.

However, something had to be done, and even if they would not afford me pain medication I at least needed to get this checked out. You don't want to fuck up your kidneys. I stumbled in and was taken to triage. They took one look at me and it was clear I was not having a good time. Vitals checked, now it's timed to get blood drawn. The first barrier. They draw from my left, by far the worst of the two. They tell me to go to another area, but as I get up a nurse says, ""Sit down, I'm gonna give you something for the pain."" Thank Christ.

I got a IM injection of Toradol which I had never heard of (worrying) and which I now know is a NSAID. This shit actually brought my pain down to not great, but fairly managebale pain. I had to wait until a room was ready for me. I was pretty impressed this weak ass drug actually did something and they get me a room and get a CT going. 

In the meantime they don't give me any narcotics but ask how comfortable I am. Im honest and say for now I'm ok but the pain is coming in waves. I'm not really trying to score opiates. I honestly should stay away if possible. An hour later though and I'm back to writhing and call the nurse. The doc who breifly saw me earlier before being pulled away said give him some morphine. The nurse starts prepping an IV line.

She looks at my arm, sees the scaring, and says she's gonna go above it to avoid it. The cat is definitely out the bag now, but I don't care since I'm still getting the morphine. And I was thankful because it nearly instaneously brought me to normalcy. Cool, but I figure the mercy is up since it obvious to the staff now that I had drug addiction issues.

Nope, the doctor comes in and says they saw a stone, I'm getting a script until I see a urologist, and she even gave me a Norco to take there before I left. I was pretty amazed that I got narcotics after it was clear I had an IV drug abuse history. Especially in the current climate around pain meds today. It probably helped that I obviously was in pain and clearly did have stones, but I've heard some horror stories.

A sad and surreal aspect of the trip was a girl in the room next me was there on an OD. She'd been narcan'd and was alert, then she tried to just dip out the side. The nurses were arguing with her, saying she can get discharged but can't just dip. Then she did just dip after agreeing to stay. Then her boyfriend was calling threatening the nurses. They were all talking about security and what an asshole this guy is. Next there is someone on the phone talking about social workers on their way and the children of the girl. I was being wheeled out for my CT and could hear the staff saying something like, ""The younger daughter is happy, playful, and social, but the older daughter is showing signs....."" and then I was around the corner.",1529037518.0

I've been wanting to do this for a long, long time.  I have become acquainted with some of you throughout the years-some of which have been good experiences, some of which have been awful.  


I guess this is what we call a shitpost.  I really wish I had something meaningful to say.  I have been doing heroin for about four years now.  Its an on-again-off-again kind of thing, as I have never let my habit grow too large.  That being said I do go through stints of daily use.  These runs consist of somewhere between 1-3 bags of ECP daily, used in small quantities throughout the day.  Heroin gives me the motivation to accomplish tasks and be social, but it robs me of the human elements of life.  I may get more things done, but I am less thoughtful, and overall less creative.  I have been maintaining using Kratom recently which is a godsend, however I think it only works because my habit isn't too large.  I am working on quitting again, as I am sick the cycle that we all know too well.  I make good money, but I'm always running short by the end of the month.  I want to be a more balanced individual.  That being said the ups and downs of addiction hold their own attractions in a fucked up, twisted kind of way.  


I have tried going to meetings and therapy in order to stop using drugs.  I've been to hundreds of NA meetings but I'm just not sure that its for me.  Therapy was moderately helpful, but I found myself lying to my therapist so I concluded it was a waste of time.  Like I said earlier, Kratom has really been the most helpful thing for me.  After finding Kratom, I have become a huge advocate for maintenance therapy.  Every opiate addict deserves to have a maintenance option, and in my ideal world, this would come at no cost to them.  Maintenance is truly lifesaving, and from a societal and financial point of view is 100&#37; justifiable.  


Lastly I just want to say that I am very self conscious that most of my sentences start with ""I"".  It makes me feel very self-centered and selfish.  Shoutouts to all the contributors to this subreddit and the internet at large, as it is actually pretty difficult to write a post.  There is a lot of uncertainty about what to say and the format is so free-form!  You really have to think about what you want to say.  Anyways hope everyone has a good night, good day, good life!

Anyway I've foolishly prided myself on chipping for years and never using long or hard enough to get sick. Well, after a week of 180+ mg OC a day, combined with 40mg of Opana a day for the second half of said week... I felt pretty shitty when the fun ran out. My WD was very very mild, I had been through much worse, but after one rough day I got in the tank and the next day I woke up and felt totally re-set / refreshed.

I think in intense, long-habit acute WD it'd probably be very very tough to sit still in a tank for 90 minutes. but for anyone in PAWS looking to break up the monotony of not using and feeling dull, or for anyone in MILD wd... give it a shot (although its not the cheapest ""cure"" out there)

TLDR; if you began withdrawing the syringe from the vien, while still releasing small volumes of liquid-- leading sayyyy 0.05ml of fluid to accumulate between the skin and vien (during its exit). am i in any sort of danger? everything was sterile to OCD or medical standards




I wont upload pics cos im too paranoid for that.

however-- being right handed, i tried to inject into the crook of my left forearm; but got scared and pulled it out (no blood entered the syringe like i thought was supposed to happen, however after removing it-- it was obviously a vein bleeding). turns out the 30g syringes i have are quite hard to draw on with one finger...

so i retried on the other arm, with my less synchronized left-hand... I think as i began pulling out the shot my thumb was still on the plunger and so a small amount of liquid continued to be released as the needle was being withdrawn.

it was initially a bit red, but thats subsided a fair bit-- what is petrifying me is this very small lump above the vein. less raised than most pimples, and skin coloured.

it is very small-- but could this be an abcess???? please tell me im over reacting. I believe a very small amount of fluid was left between the skin and the vein. the small lump has a yellowish tinge to it (not unlike the liquid in the syringe), and the surrounding area just seems mildly blotchy

Haven't slept for 3 days and can't currently get any benzo's or into a doctor. I'm completely exhausted and going nuts here. Will 1 shot to sleep for a night set me back completely? Yes it's a slippery slope and all that for most people, but it *will* be one shot, no more. 

Seems to me like it would likely set me back, but it also seems sort of like a long taper. I realize it may extend withdrawal a little, but at this point 1 night of sleep may be worth it if it doesn't start me over completely. If I don't, I'll probably go until day 6 or 7 without sleeping. 

Anybody with any experience trying it?",1528994908.0

Anyway, I have a Codeine script that normally saves me. Today, I took 400mg Codeine and most of withdraws disappeared.

I've decided i'm going to quit again (and I always do, the problem is for how long...)

Anyways, to end this binge i've got 15 sealed sterile needles (30g, 1/2 inch needle length) which I plan to use over 5 days at 3 doses a day. I only bought 5 sterile mixing cups (the metal ones you get from needle exchanges instead of spoons)

So for question number 1; Would it be bad IV practice to use the same mixing cup/'spoon' everyday while changing filter and syringe for every dose? (I.e cooking aparatus replaced once daily, rigs and filters replaced after every use-- 3x daily)

they said the sterile spoons were for one time use-- but i suspect they say this to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, I use alone so this is a non-issue. I don't see how reminants of water, heroin and vitamin-c will lead to a blood borne infection, at least not over the period of a single day

My second question is-- I am obviously going to start **low**, If say-- my first dose was *too* low, could I retry again with that same needle? assuming of course i hit the vien on the first try every time (i *was* a bodybuilder, but remain very lean and vascular-- my arms are naturally tourniqued so i cant imagine missing one of my fat viens). I know syringes blunt with every time they penetrate the skin-- but surely it is not necessary to throw it away after a single insertion? we are talking a 2nd attempt MAX here, so that i dont risk an OD (and once i know my dose, this wont be necessary). I do not wish to experience any scarring whatsoever, ive got alchohol swabs and the lot and am being very medicinal/OCD about this. Would a 2nd attempt leave a scar?

Any advice would be much appreciated",1528990312.0

So, I'll do my best not to rant too long here, but brevity and I rarely see eye-to-eye, so let me go ahead and apologize for the length.  First ever post on reddit.  I've lurked this forum for roughly a year now, and I feel like I know a number of you, though I obviously don't.  I didn't even make this account until a few months back, thinking I would post then, but you know, fear and anxiety, so it goes.

I've used for roughly 17 years now.  Cut my teeth on the old school 80s, things went from there as they tend to do.  I've had fairly sizable daily habits in the past, but I don't get to indulge too much these days.  The old back and forth of a handful of days sober, only to end up caving in and doing more.  Which of course wouldn't make sense to a lot of folks, but I know I don't have to explain that around here.  But yeah, my tolerance is pretty low these days, which is good, but I never seem to stay clean long enough to feel much stronger, mentally or physically.

Anyway, much love to all of you folks.  Seriously, I know you get a decent amount of posts like this, because I've read quite a few myself.  I keep wanting to try to put myself out there in some way, and well, I know I'm never going to do it if I don't just fucking do it.

I used to love to write, though it doesn't happen as much these days.  More inane ranting than anything.  I've lost a lot of things I've written over the years, whether it be poems/songs/stories/etc.  I always preferred the pen and pad, but after a certain point, I started typing things more often.  This was the main reason I would inevitably lose things, via hard drive crashes and the like.

I had a bit of a story written at one point, one that I really liked where it was going, even though I wasn't quite sure where I was taking it.  I ended up losing it, but tried to recreate it years later.  Naturally, we're always our own worst critics, but I don't think what I have now is as good as what I once had.  Then again, that's how life goes, eh?  Nostalgia is arguably the most intriguing emotion of all.  And, in the words of Oscar Martinez, time is a son of a bitch...

To try to begin to wrap this up, after finding a few things that I had written or rewritten over the past few years, I wanted to share something here.  Something heartfelt, though possibly trite.  I could go further into the origin of the story, but it's probably much less interesting that letting you interpret it as you will.  I didn't expect this part of the post to go on for so long, but I am mildly buzzing right now, and extremely bored, so there's that.  Regardless, if you're still reading at this point, all the love in the world to you.  And even if you aren't still reading, hey, that's understandable.  I genuinely hope you're all doing as well as you can be, whether stone sober or nodding like a motherfucker.) <3

It was a dark and rainy night.  Water cascading off of the windshield, reflecting light in the loveliest of colors.  Your eyes glowing as they met mine, assuring me I was fine.  You had me convinced we were looking through the same set of eyes, though you always seemed to wear your emotions as a disguise, I wasn't privy to this information at the time.

It's hard to blame you, though you clearly had plenty of faults, it's not as though we both didn't.  We had wonderful conversations that night.  Of blue flowers and wooden coffins, of how things could only improve from here.

It felt like you believed in me.  Fuck, you made me believe in myself, a more difficult task than I wish it were.  Bombarded by waves of various emotions, we smiled seas and cried oceans.  You touched my face as we kissed, you held me as I stroked your auburn hair.  We shared bowls and smokes, all while watching as the moonlight cheered us on from afar. 

I thought we would take on the world, you and I.  But it really didn't matter, you were becoming my world.  Obsession can be deadly, yet also weirdly necessary.  I felt at peace for the first time in my life.  It was a dark, rainy, beautiful night...",1528955302.0

My question is for those who can successfully chip. How often do you use and how often do you take breaks?

Love you all first of all, this is just a quick post I had to make or well, I feel I had to make.

So, in withdrawal as I have been plenty of times before over the past 4-5 years of my addiction (on and off, 2 rehabs you get the jist) I currently am on day 2, and I sit here with massive amounts of goosebumps while I sweat the goosebumps keep on happening over and over. Of course, cold sweat. Not fun.

I sat there and realized I am just sitting here watching TV as If I normally would be doing, if I was high; but alas I am not high I ran out 2 days ago. Fire heroin, DNMs, expensive shit. Well, as I sit here with goosebumps I realize my emotions are all here, right now. My senses are back, its hard to explain but ya'll know what I mean it's like you walk outside and everything is heightened sounds smells etc (esp. b/c I sniff, probably) the smells are insane its weird pizza even smelt overwhelming earlier as you guys know this is what withdrawal is like; and it feels shitty for the most part of course.

But, why not just enjoy this time that I have right now while I have my emotions? It's an awesome thing, even though I feel like shit. Music sounds amazing, it's like I realize what the fuck I had not been enjoying music the past 6 months or so I have been using for fucks sake its orgasmic. 

I know when I got clean the last time, it was like that too for me. But any of my fellow opiate lovers do this? Like, shit the emotions are here right now, enjoy it before you pick up again. 

I am probably going to have dope tomorrow, so why not enjoy the moments I have with my emotions back for now since I know I'm just gonna use again as I am not in the mindset to stop right now. 

Weird thought I guess, because feeling like shit may overpower the willpower to even try to feel ""good"". We all sit and loathe during withdrawal I feel like- or at least I just was until I realized fuck I am wasting precious energy as my soul is here right now whereas when I am high it's kind of like I am a ghost in a shell. 

I also notice I laugh my fuckin ass off at random shit as if I am manic, due to the heightened emotions and senses. And it does feel good.. so try and laugh if you're on day 2 like me.. <3

Since then I’ve had my fair share of experiences with DMT LSD NO2 Weed etc. but I still crave that sweet sweet euphoric bliss that is the nod. I’m young so it feels to me that being high is all I’ve ever known. I’m about 30 days sober off of all substances now and none of their absences really bother me that much except for the opiates. I swear it’s like every time I get mildly stressed or have somewhat of a hard time falling asleep my mind wanders to MBox 30s until it becomes totally obsessive. How long until this is out of my fucking head? A lot of my friends who’ve gotten clean say that it is just a month or two that really sucks and then after that if you keep your mind occupied it doesn’t keep bothering you. I keep myself very occupied but slipping into a strong nod is all I can really hope.
Is it possible I’m just not ready to quit? I’ve maintained a lot of sober time willingly it’s not like I’m out on the street looking for it and I’ve made a lot of progress on myself as a person but I just want some opiates for fucks sake. In reality am I bound to relapse because I have maintained such frequent thoughts and cravings through a long period of sobriety? I feel like I haven’t hit that rock bottom a lot of people need before they realize it’s time to get sober. Other than suffering with mental health and addiction I kept up good grades in school, stayed out of trouble, kept up a friend group, have a girlfriend I just didn’t like being dependent on anything for so long but I just don’t think I’m psychologically ready to give up opiates for good.

The first time I tried meth, I smoked it and went on a 3 day bender that included no sleep or food. It was great, and I totally saw the appeal. But I didn't really fall in love until my first time IVing it. 

It was a Saturday night, my ex and I were at Walmart. I wanted to steal another TV to trade to our dealer for some dope. We'd already traded the 43"" smart TV I boosted. My ex (let's just call him T for story's sake) was ready to go home but my degenerate junkie ass was not having it! Let's just try one more store, I got this! Sure, OK. So we are standing outside the store before going in so T could smoke a cig. He's chatting with some employee that's outside on a smoke break. Out comes your stereotypical homeless junkie lookin' dude. Within a minute he mentions beans. Beans?! T and I lock eyes with that devious grin. *beans are capsules of heroin in the Midwest, just to clarify*. So T is the smooth talker out of us both and when it comes to manipulating in the drug game, he takes the cake. Within minutes the three of us are in our truck, giving this random dude, Juice, a ride home in exchange for a bean each. 

Except we never actually take him home. Once we realize he has slew of drugs on him, we push things a bit like the junkies we are. T and Juice bullshit back and forth for a bit, I add in my charm wherever needed. T butters him up some and it wasn't long before Juice pulls out like two grams of shard and lets us try some. We ended up spending the next twelve hours with this random dude, and going through the entire bag of meth. But that first shot is what really stands out in my memory. I'd considered snorting it, but we had rigs on us and I was feeling impulsive and had never banged it before. 

I disregard T telling me not to go too hard and prep up a fat shot, shaking in excitement at getting to try IVing it. I hand T my loaded rig, as I didn't know how to hit myself yet. I wrap the phone charger cord around my arm to tie off, and hold my arm out across the front seat. I look away, still squeamish about needles and blood (when in just a few weeks I'd be relentlessly poking myself with hooked needles and bleeding everywhere). Despite being in a dark car, T hits me on the first try - as always, he was a pro at hitting himself and others. Immediately I'm hit with a rush I'll never forget. I wanted to puke. I wanted to talk a million words per minute. I wanted to move. I wanted to do everything. I wanted to feel like this forever.

I'm over a month clean from heroin, almost never crave it, but god damn do I want some meth. ",1528935719.0

We are opening our first detox facility, and seeing that California just legalized medical marijuana, we want to be one of the first facilities to offer CBD Oil as a service to help with the detox process because of its awesome effects in helping the body through various symptoms. We know a lot of users are tired of the conventional treatments for substance abuse detox, and we truly believe CBD oil will be a safer, healthier alternative!

How likely would you be to admit yourself to a detox facility if it offered CBD oil/edibles/water/aromatherapy as one of it's services to aid the detoxification process? Is this a particular aspect that would interest you? Or maybe, would it discourage you from admitting yourself? Do you think your significant other/family member would admit you if they saw CBD oil was an option at our facility?

So I just scored a sealed bottle of IV Morphine 300 mg/ 20mL (15mg/mL), while I have a long and storied history of opiate abuse, my SO doesn't and as I'd like to safely dose him I could use some help as the dosage calculators are confusing me a bit. For the last year or so he's been snorting about 90mg Oxycodone approximately 3\-8 times a month, with the last three weeks being more like 2\-3 times a week. Each time we score he does his three 30mg pills within 3\-5 hours.

I injected it in my forearm near the elbow. Soon after, the bottom of my arm and my hand went numb. Then my hand curled into a hook kinda, and i couldnt move it at all. Naturally I freaked out. I was in my college dorm with my roommate who didnt use drugs or know that I did. (Well he knew i smoked weed). I told him i slept on it wrong.

I called the campus health center, and they made me come in. And me, being completely unable to admit the truth (my parents didnt know I used), told them that I slept on it wrong. This was one of the most selfish things i have ever done. This lead to my very worried parents taking me to see a bunch of specialists like neurologists to see what could be the problem. I didnt tell them what happened until way later when i came clean to my parents about my addiction and went to treatment the first time.

How much will this set me back?","Today is day 4 of going cold turkey off a 60-80mg Oxy/Hydro habit. Last few days I've dealt with cold sweats and lack of appetite, causing pain in my stomach. Today, even though I smoked some weed and managed get some food in, my stomach is in extreme pain. This isn't the same pain as last few days because that was from hunger. This pain actually hurts right in the pit of my stomach.

Although I've been strong thus far, I'm seriously considering taking 10-20mg of Hydrocodone Bitartrate. I have 150ml of 1mg/1ml liquid solution and don't ever want to get back on opiates because of how bad the withdrawals are every time. How far will this set me back provided I only take this one dose just to get the pain to go away? I'm pretty desperate right now. Or does anyone have any suggestions on how i can relieve this pain? It feels kind of like cramps but right in the centre there is a heavy and somewhat sharp pain.

I relapsed on a 4 month dope binge, about a half gram a day. My savings were running out, knew I wouldn't be able to pay rent if I kept it up, so I had to kick. AFAIK, nobody outside of my connects and one AA friend knows.

So I bought 6, 8/2 suboxone strips. It's hard to recall exactly how I tapered.

Day 1: 8mg

Day 2-4: 4mg

Day 4-5 (maybe 6): 2mg

Day 6-9: 1mg

Day 10-12: .5mg

Then slivers (.1-3mg) every 2-3 days when unbearable (still had to show up to work/life.)

I have a lot of sub left if needed but I want to get it out of my system. I have been exercising a fuck ton and getting sun to stay sane. My big problems are sleep (sweating as fucking / insomnia) and anxiety (I got a panic attack at work the other day and cried).

Tools left:

Xanax (taken about .75mg at most, 6mg total in detox, usually for sleep)

Gabapentin (I try to take 600mg but doesn't seem to do much, have a fuck ton left from last rehab)

Ambien (haven't used)

Clonidine (haven't used, when do I use this?)

Caffeine (energy drinks to wake up for work, 80-160mg caffeine)

Thc

CBD (seperate from THC): I use sometimes but idk if it does much

Melatonin (used once)

I wish I had trazodone, valium or phenobarbital, and flexeril/soma... I could look on craigslist for kpins or valium, doubt I'd find the others.

Weed is really hard for me to stop and provokes anxiety so I want to stay away but I have used some.

Today I woke up and had chills / diarrhea but could be from a good sleep (xanax/gabapentin) after lots of days at work and insomnia.

Hoping chills/diarrhea could mean i'm in the next phase of wd / my body has almost purged all the opiates out.

TLDR; kicking dope w/ subs/xans, need advice. Worst parts are sweating, anxiety, insomnia (xanax helps all but don't want to trade one addiction for another.

Can we compile a helpful document to help with home withdrawal? Hear me out.,"Most people who develop an addiction/dependence on opiates have gone through withdrawal at least once, and for most us us (myself included), have gone through it many times when we either run out of our shit or want to get clean. With that said, I come to this community to seek help in composing a withdrawal cheat sheet or FAQ sheet. This will not be your ordinary cheat sheet that contains tips on how it will help the user get through it; we have those on here and other parts of the internet. What I am looking to help create is a sheet that is for your friends, family, significant others, etc. (read: people who have never been through it), to use and help understand what exactly is going on during WDs. It can be something as basic as a do & do not list of things that they (non-users) can refer to in order to help out the person who is sick. 

It does not need to be a peer-reviewed medical journal, and I think it would be best to keep it short and concise. Maybe it can cover:

What is going on physically

What is going on mentally

A basic timeline explaining how long it would take each set of symptoms to subside

What to do to help

What NOT to do to help

When to seek real professional help (I'm thinking call 911 type of help, not treatment)

This thought just crossed my mind because I am about to do a home detox and want to make it as easy as possible for all parties involved. I have been through it enough to know what to expect and all that shit, but this list is for people who do not have a ton, or any, WD experience. Feel free to add or remove items from my list, or downvote this to hell because it is stupid. I don't care. This is a throwaway anyway.
Stay safe out there.

I don't think this version has been posted, so enjoy. I'll post some stories about before I turned to IVing soon.)**

---

I was the prototypical junky. Long semi-oily hair, skinny as a rail and unreliable as fuck. I woke up in the morning to sweat-soaked shits and kicking legs, and immediately checked my phone. Did I already have a message? Yeah, probably. Dan: “hey get ur ass up”. I was the money man. I was the middle class kid who always figured out a scheme or a scam to get the hundreds of dollars a day we needed. They were simply the middlemen. I take a bite of my strawberry cereal bar, the whole 100 calories it was in its entirety. I gag at the taste, even though I used to eat these like candy. I’m already sick as fuck but also constipated at the same time. Don’t ask, I never got the shits until around day 3 of withdrawal… If I'm lucky I'm alone and can walk out of my house unbothered. Otherwise, my parents were standing right there, like the army lieutenant from Full Metal Jacket (or that’s is how I saw them for the past few months). “oh hey mom… I'm going out for a bike ride.” She shakes her head. There towards the end she didn’t even have the words to say to me anymore. My heart broke more and more each day. 

I rolled on out the blacktop driveway as I made a stop in the bushes right across from our old wooden fence dividing the property line. I quickly but calmly grab my rig (short tip, long tip or any size. Hell, even bent. My longest running was nicknamed “Coffin Nail”) from a random spot in the bushes I had thrown it the previous night. Could NOT be bringing that onto my property with the way my parents are. I continue walking out this little country backroad as I’m staring at my phone waiting for the call from Dan or Dillon that they are pulling onto my street. I listen to Burrough’s Junky on audiotape from youtube (and about how his maid said opium brought sweet dreams. That sounds better than the oxymorphone nightmares), and suddenly the phone rings. it is them. “Hey man get to the graveyard to meet us quick, Dillon has a credit card we can use to turn into cash. You can figure out how, right?”. Oh fuck.. How am I gonna do this? Of course I would figure it out but OF COURSE I can’t rightly say how either. Nonetheless, one could likely wonder how I ended up in this position, so let’s get back to that for a second.


[drug den 2.0, 8PM june or april(?)]

It was a calm day in April as I stood within a small 5x10 laundry room with bleach, appliances and every single thing you would need to shoot up some little rubber pills. I wondered to myself… “there’s no way you can IV these things. I’ve seen the threads on bluelight. This will fucking kill you”. I kept thinking and realized I ultimately didn’t care. It was just once, right? I wanted to feel that rush, damnit! I was just a young drug aficionado who wanted to push that limit time after time. Dillon has this stupid fucking smirk painted upon his face and nothing could change it. He was filled with glee regarding the damage I was about to instill upon myself. It was actually quite morbid now that I think about it. Dan on the other hand had the blankest expression I have ever seen. If I were not a man of logic and reason I would tell you that his eyes were pitch black that day. That is how they looked anyhow.

He reached for the fresh pack of insulin syringes in the cupboard above and tells Dillon to fetch some warm water from the kitchen. “Make sure it’s fucking warm this time!”, Dan insists. I watch him carefully dip the pill, wipe the coating on his worn, old red long sleeves and stick a quarter of a yellow E series opana 40mg onto an aluminum foil tray he made. He turns on a nearby toaster (the fuck is that doing here?) and begins to let it warm up. “Oh.. you have to cook these by the way”, he just now tells me. I knew it would be a rough process but not this rough. Okay, I’ll survive. They have so far, right?

Before I know it, the pill is mixed atop a coca cola can (bottom side up) into the gross, black and brown amalgamation which was thicker than the sweetest honey this side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I see Dan bite off the end of a cig filter (sweet, more lack of sterility for me to cringe at. Ahh.. how things would soon change) and throw it into the mix. He begins to draw up this honey into the orange tipped insulin syringe. “Hold out your arm”, he says. I hold up my arm, shaking all over from nerves. How would it feel, I wonder. He says I will feel a poke just as the doctors say. I feel it, but it isn’t bad. I kinda liked it already. I now actually turn my head towards him to watch how he does it. I’m not squeamish anymore. I noticed the little tiny sea of red blood rush into the brown moat of oxymorphone solution. Uh oh… this is it. “I’m in..”, says Dan. I watch as he slowly but steadily pushes down the plunger, and I’m already feeling it…

It begins in my forehead, like an exotic kiss from the ghost of all my past loves combined. It was so warm and inviting, so quick and powerful. So natural, so real and delightful. It felt like meshing souls with the gods (or demons). I felt my body go completely numb with euphoria and I was sitting on flowers. I was wrapped so tightly in the opiate blanket I couldn't move much at all. I was back in the womb again, but it looks like the forest from alice in wonderland. Everything has a feint glow to it. Colors are much more vibrant. Everything is now soft to the touch, no pain or discomfort could see its way through this chemical Wall of China. I remained blissfully trapped in this little wooden kitchen chair, in the back of some old ladies home, a legit drug den. All my anxieties and all my fears, all my hesitation about the thoughts of my peers and family,  were all gone now. I look up with glossy eyes and a similar shit-eating smirk as Dillon had earlier. “How is it”, they both say in unison. I muttered out, “pretty fucking amazing. Everything I thought it would be and more...” This is it, I knew already in the back of mind. This is how I want to feel forever. 

I didn’t hang around long. Even while high as a fucking kite, I knew I had to get out of this bed bug infested home. My mom and I would both freak if we got them. I gave my appreciation as everyone’s mouth dropped that I was capable of getting up at all, let alone ride my bike home. This became a common theme with myself and my drug addict friends. They were always amazed at my natural inclination to “handle my shit”. Maybe it was simply a natural tolerance. I’m not quite sure still but it applied to all types of drugs. I floated down the brick steps under the glass sliding door connect this den to the outside world. We would usually sneak in this way as to not bother the actual tenant of the home. She was chill with all us junkies hanging around apparently. She just knew we would be dead or in jail otherwise I guess. I hop on my 250$ mountain bike that is supposed to be shared with my mom. She never uses it though. It has become my daily driver for my drug missions. It really sucks in a town with not enough sidewalks, and drunk/high rednecks swerving all over the pothole infested and cracked road. 

I did not even care tonight. I couldn’t see well, but my instinct was guiding me home. Home was my happy place, and on my peaceful bed I would always meditate. (Ever gone into a meditative state while high on IV opiates? It is bliss and even better than just the typical nod. I told myself I was repairing all the damage I had done to my brain. Ha, yeah…)

I glide down the sidewalk beside the bank at warp speed but to me it feels like slow motion. My pupils were pinned and my eyelids were so heavy I can barely keep them open long enough to see I’m on the pavement. I continue downhill past the funeral homes, dollar stores, prostitutes and pharmacies which now dominate this small town. I pass the government living buildings in downtown, which I normally don’t like biking past due to sketchiness of the road AND the people. However, on this night, bring it on. I was one of them now. They all loved me. Just show them your fresh track marks! Shit is like a badge now. I was feeling all chill about it on the ride home, and for the rest of the night as I crawled up in bed after meditation and threw on some adventure time. 

I remember shutting off all my lights and barely cracking my door, implying I’m asleep. No way I wanted to deal with my parents now. I doze in and out for a few hours in a blissful haze similar to the time I sniffed some heroin but a lot stronger. There was literally no way for me to stay awake long like this. The pull of my bed’s comfort was in its prime state. A state only achieved with chemical influence. I go to bed for a presumably dreamless night, but if I did dream it was probably already about shooting up. 

In the morning I awoke, and everything was normal for a brief moment. I look around and stretch, when I see it. A big nasty bruise and red puffy lump on the crook of my left arm from the needle’s bite. I feel an extremely intense feeling of disgust wash over me like all the litter in the ocean just came and I bathed in it. 

I felt like scum, and I was never gonna do that again…

Found a plug that let me get 100 mg tram  2/1$ and got myself hooked in college. The plug and I disagreed on something and we broke ties. I found a new plug to get me oxy at .50-1$/mg. This was great because I had enough money to buy about 60-90 pills (10mg and 15mg) a week and was functioning perfectly.

Eventually that plug claimed to sell me some pink 10s (never played me before) and I had a bad feeling about it. Anyway she hands me some pinks and I drive off. The letters appear to be scratched off but I didn’t think TOO much about that bc the bitch was a junkie herself and she’s never played me before. Long story short they were fake pills and when I called her back she blocked me and I had no way of contacting.

Then went to another guy who charges outrageous prices for oxy but none the less got myself hooked on 30s to the point where I need them every couple hours to function and feel normal. If they were less expensive and more accessible I wouldn’t have this problem.

I’m considering going on methadone therapy to let myself chill and rewire my brain to function without oxy and hydro. I also understand that a lot of you would consider this a light habit in comparison to H and other things. For me it’s a problem because it’s draining all of my money.

I'm a doctoral student in sociology at NYU, where I research missing persons.

As part of my research, I’m trying to learn more about how and why people end up listed as missing, which isn't very well understood by either academics or law enforcement. To that end, I'm currently interviewing people who have formerly been classified as missing, either formally or informally, for a peer\-reviewed academic paper.

I’m posting here because, anecdotally, I’m finding out that a significant number of people who end up missing are dealing with opiate addiction. This keeps coming up in interviews with families of the missing, as well as in social media posts about missing persons cases. I'd really like to learn more about this, as there’s virtually no research on this topic.

If you were ever a missing person, even for a short time, I'd love to hear more about your experience. If you're interested in participating, please fill out the form below. All interviews are confidential. And, if you have any questions, I can be reached by DM.

I also preferred tar because less likely to be cut with fent and I loved the taste when smoked. Tasted like bbq. A huge benefit bth has over ecp is if you're caught by someone besides police you can play it off as hash. 

ECP was stronger most of the the time. The strongest  bth I ever did was not as strong as the best ecp I ever did.  I felt tar had more legs too, but also a worse withdrawal.  

Also to anyone who has had #3 as well as bth and ecp could you compare.

Like I said I know it's been asked before but just wanted a new discussion.
Thanks everyone and have a great day.",1528903513.0

I was prescribed it for the off label use of anxiety/depression after a year of trying 7 different meds, therapy and TMS. I pulled my back and was prescribed a narcotic and was told by the urgent care doc to stop taking it as there may be some negative interaction. I then proceeded to have some of the best sleep I’ve had in a while for two days, but then shit got real. 

I starting taking Gabapentin around November and loved it. I just as quickly started developing sleep issues but didn’t make the connection. The medication was taken consistently with 2/3 days of misuse just to see what it did (damn you Google) but for the most part taken as directed, 3x100 mg daily. Around Jan I started taking 300 mg all at one time, I don’t remember why. Beginning of Feb I started taking it sporadically as I started to feel the best I had felt in over a year, me thinking it was because of a much needed career change and TMS therapy.  I was on the road to mental health recovery and didn’t want to be on meds anymore. But around mid Feb I started developing body tremors and sleeplessness. Staying up late because I couldn’t fall asleep but then sleeping 7/8 hours, no big deal, as I was not working and could sleep in if I needed to. But then I would fall asleep then wake up about wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep for hours. Plus I started having stomach issues and gained 10lbs in about 5 weeks. I got checked for thyroid issues and leaky gut, both negative. I also went and had blood work done and checked for vitamin deficiencies, still waiting to hear on those. But I finally made the connection that it was because of the Gabapentin. 

Some other notes. My symptoms: bloating, stomach pain/organ swelling, insomnia, mild anxiety, internal body tremors/heart palpations, throat fluttering, occasional headache, weight gain. I have tried everything for relief over the last few months. Valerian root, CBD oil, pancreatin, turmeric w/black pepper, gaba supplement, thyroid therapy (hypo), thyroid calming (hyper), otc sleep aids, trazadone, magnesium citrate, and now magnesium orotate, lemon balm, lemon grass, B12 and biotin vitamins. They all (except hypo thyroid supplement) knock me out the 1st day and then palpations come back with a vengeance the next day and then bye bye blessed sleep. 

I’m on day 12 of the withdrawal and it does get better daily, but that first week is a bitch. The exhaustion and not knowing what’s wrong with you is overwhelming and I could barely function and was incredibly irritable. Thankfully not too much anxiety. Now knowing what the problem is and lessening of symptoms makes this bearable but it still sux.  My stomach pains, and bloating went away, I did adapt a healthier vegetable, fruit, low carb diet, and added probiotics tabs, komucha, and yogurt cut out fatty fried foods and junk, etc. I’ve lost 2 lbs, since my back prompted this so that’s awesome. Now I’m just trying to figure out the sleep as I’m getting 1\-3 hrs, sometimes at one, or spread out throughout the night.

I’m going to do a celery juice cleanse for 3 or 4 days maybe longer to detox my liver, as the palpations may be caused by a fatty liver. I also had a colonic on day 8 and plan to have 2 more to detox me. I’ve also reduced my alcohol intake and plan to start working out as I was already 170lb at 5’4”.

I remember coming off of Effexor and thinking that that was horrible. That was a cake walk comparatively, the brain zaps lasted for about a month after the last dose.  I didn’t have to take anything more than a multivitamin and magnesium and I could sleep. Right now I’m just taking the gaba, b12, biotin, magnesium orotate and turmeric. Hopefully I’ll be able to sleep soon.",1528893776.0

They're all just going to judge me for my life choices while they stick a rig in their arms. I know this isn't opiates recovery or whatever but I feel most comfortable here after all is said and done. I'm just so lost, idk like I know I should be feeling some sort of emotion right now but I feel disturbingly numb and just want to stay focused on conversation instead of other shit. 

I have to go to court in a bit to show support for another dog owner fighting with the pound and I'm just trying to stay busy/distracted until then. 

Even though I relapsed it was more of a sure what the fuck it's here and free bullshit and I feel no desire to keep actively seeking it or wasting my own money. I was given free boy, crack, ice, and Molly over the course of the day. Turn down free drugs? I think not, each one of them left me feeling disappointed and questioning how I'd done that to myself for so long? Or more importantly wasted so much money?

I keep feeling like I'm broken or something, I got out way to easy with drugs and can dabble way to easy. I feel like I'm cheating something somehow. Like, I keep waiting on the other shoe to drop but I suppose it could be argued the shit I'm dealing with in life could be that other shoe. I've realized I'm surrounded by addicts and I can't help but think like how are they not burned out? This can't be all they plan for life. I'm working on getting my life back in order and spoiling myself because I always swore to myself I'd never let the drugs completely control me, as far as my own definitions and shit they haven't. I might be in questionable living situations now but fuck I did this shit before drugs too just because I get to burned out and tired of the same in and out daily routine life. I like building something from nothing as a weird  uncommon addiction kind of. 

So now here I sit cold and to lazy to roll up the car windows finding myself alone and in my feelings yet again. I got friends, I got support but sometimes you just want to cut off from the world and go hide elsewhere. My elsewhere is Reddit right now.

I woke up at 11am to walk down to the hood as my dealer wakes up around 11:30 every day. As I walked up to the gas station I saw him turning in before I even called him, so I took out my $20 to cop my 5/10 gunpowder. (FML... it's been so underwhelming lately, but where else am I gonna go with a $20 bill) I'm thinking my luck is gonna be good.... grab the cap, and head to McDonalds.

Go into the stall. Now, my fucking rig is stuck. It sucks being in Florida as it is SO difficult to get a rig I end up using the same one over and over again and trashing my veins. So I start trying to lube up the plunger and finally succeed. Get some water into my hand and draw it up.... *fuck. My cap was in that hand.*

So now I have this squishy fucking cap and I cant open it so I just put the entire cap into the spoon with water and start trying to dissolve it. I'm starting to really sweat now and I'm sick out of my mind so I all I can think of is getting this shot together. I can't find my filter for like 2 minutes. Finally, I draw up the dark liquid up from this MESS in the spoon. Sit down on the toilet. Can't find a fucking vein.

Well, I'm digging around, digging around.... when I MUST HAVE NOT LOCKED THE DOOR RIGHT, BECAUSE AN OLDER GUY WALKS RIGHT INTO THE FUCKING STALL WITH ME. He stares DIRECTLY at my heroin syringe in my arm and goes ""Jesus fucking Christ!"" and FAINTS right there. Like are you fucking kidding me? What the FUCK am I gonna do now? And on top of that, I can't just put my spoon away, because it has a mess of cap and dope on it.... maybe like 30&#37; of the cap that I couldn't draw up.

In comes another guy. He sees the guy passed out on the floor, I'm struggling to put all my shit away but my spoon is still on the baby changing table and this guy is passed out preventing me from closing the stall door. This guy manages to get the old guy up, who proceeds to yell ""He's shooting heroin in there!"" To everyone in the store. Some innocent bystander is like ""I have narcan in my car!"" Amidst images of a mob of customers holding me down and forcibly narcanning me, I start running.

So I snap a pic and put it for sale for $9.99+$4 and it says Im the lowest seller, Nice!  

I buy 2 packs while Im there because who doesn't need tooth brushes. I said on amazon that I had 5 packs available (I lied). 

I go home and go to sleep. Wake up in the morning with 5 toothbrush orders!! My net is $11.59 per deal so $4.50 a pack so I just made $22ish bucks. Fuckin A! Doing nothing. I added 10 more to my Amazon listing and run off to the store. By the time I got to the store I had 3 more orders. They had about 30 packs left. I bought 20 and went home.

Past few months I have pretty curious as to trying opiates. I know it's not the best thing to be curious about, but the past year I have really been experimenting with new substances. Tried my first psychedelic, smoked weed for the first time, and even tried cocaine just a few weeks ago.

Just some background as to who I am as a person. (Not sure if this will help to what I am getting at, but possibly someone can relate or understand?) I'm 19, college student, and pretty depressed. I am actually writing this post as I am doing my calculus homework for a summer course that I am taking. Past years have been pretty brutal mentally. I think this is a big reason as to why I started dabbling into drugs; just to maybe give me some type of happiness. From a past post about heroin, one part that stuck out to me was how content the person was. I can't recall the last time I have been content and overall satisfied with anything. Here are my two questions:

What made you start using opiates?
Do you regret using them?

I appreciate any comments and would love to hear some advice from any users here. I briefly read all the rules, however if this going against in any reason, I apologize. Thanks!

I believe she has been clean, for the most part, for almost two years and has gotten it together with a new career that has lead to her being stable once again. 
She came to visit me for a couple of days and I couldn't help but notice that she could not keep her hands off her face. She had complained to me about her face breaking out and how she wanted to pop a pimple and I told her not to as it would make it worse. Well, she touched it the whole time she was here. She also kept doing the index finger sniffle motion repeatedly, kept touching her chin, finger in the ear and the list goes on. This made me uncomfortable but I did not want to confront her as I do not know much about drug use signs and symptoms.

Don’t write it off just because of a few horror stories. 


I was an heavy opiate user for about 4 years or so. It started like many other people’s stories with prescription opiates, namely norcos, morphine pills and Roxies, but quickly turned to BTH when my pill habit got too crazy. After a couple run ins with the law, constantly disappointing my family and a terrible car accident that happened under the influence (luckily I only injured myself and no one else by my stupid actions) I finally decided to get clean. I went to an outpatient suboxone treatment program and therapy to help get my head on straight and try to live a normal life. I’m currently in my 10th month of sobriety using suboxone. I have a great full time job, the trust of my family, no more debt and a much better outlook on life. And I have all of this because of the great outpatient program I’m in and suboxone. 

The reason I’m making this post is because I know that some people in recovery look at suboxone as either the devil or not being truly clean. And yes, while I am still taking an opiate drug, it is nothing like taking a drug to get high. I literally don’t feel anything from my suboxone, it simply keeps me from going through withdrawals and from constantly craving opiates. It allows me to wake up and live a normal life while thinking clearly as opposed to the mental fog induced by drug use. Suboxone really is a wonder drug for opiate addicts and I think the stigma around it should be seriously scrutinized due to the fact that suboxone has worked for so many people. The only caveat to this is you need to find a suboxone treatment program that does it right. Some programs definitely prey on vulnerable people and simply try to get them to switch to suboxone and stay on it forever for monetary gain. They don’t offer things like therapy or counseling to help a person understand why they started using to begin with and then giving them the tools to deal with these things in a health way. They don’t offer any help other than a prescription. However, there are many more programs that do offer these things and I believe that, in conjunction with suboxone, therapy and counseling can help a person truly overcome addiction. I guess what I’m really trying to say is, don’t think that all suboxone programs are there to scam you. Some definitely are, but if you find the right one it can be life changing. If you’re looking to get sober, try to find a program that offers suboxone treatment and mental health counseling among other tools to help you stay sober. Another thing, try and find a program that has a taper schedule planned out from the beginning. My program is 2 years long, however it can be shortened if the patient shows significant improvement throughout the first year. I plan on starting my taper within the next 3 months and I don’t even have the slightest urge to use again. Idk, I just feel like this needed to be said. Suboxone really is a great tool for recovery and if you want to get sober, it is one of the best options us opiate addicts have. 

That’s all I really had to say. Don’t right off suboxone completely because of some of the horror stories you here. If you find the right program, it can be a god send. If anyone has any questions about anything I said or the program I’m in, just lmk. ",1528844879.0

These look WAY more blue than the ones I’ve gotten in the past, but I’ve also never gotten the V 4812s before.

I guess they’re kind of quick stories with questions attached. Thanks in advance for any helpful responses!

1) I brought my homie back from an OD over Memorial Day with mouth to mouth resuscitation. EMT’s got there right as he woke up and gave him 2mg to be safe but I brought him back with only a few breaths. He fell out pretty hard though, completely stopped breathing, etc. None of that is very surprising or unusual, but the one weird thing was his jaw was clamped shut super hard. I have a dent in my thumbnail from trying to pry his teeth apart. Managed to somehow still get some air in him but I’ve never really seen/heard of that before. I clench my teeth pretty often from anxiety/etc but I’ve never been told that I did it during an overdose (I’ve had a few too many).

Is that a common thing? If not, anyone else here seen/experienced that? Or know why it happens? Btw this happened immediately, it wasn’t like I found him that way, it all happened in front of me.

… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … 

… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … 


2) I’ve been on subutex for 6 months, started with 8mg which got me feeling 100% better after going through pretty much full WD for about 5 days beforehand (from a .2-.5/day BTH habit). I’ve been on and off the sub all year, usually 2-4mg/day or less, and never off sub/shooting dope for longer than maybe a week. 

I just got off about a two week run shooting dope the other day (think I dosed sub one day in the middle of it) and I started getting pretty sick about maybe 18 hrs after my last shot. I’ve never put myself into PWD from sub but I’m not trying to risk it either, so I started with just a little bit of an 8mg tab. 

Didn’t get any sicker but didn’t feel any better either so I kept taking 1-2mg at a time until I’d taken 8mg without much relief to speak of. Only brought one with me bc I didn’t even think I’d need the whole thing, but I ended up having to bail on my friends and take the bus 2 hours to get home. 

When I got home I kept taking more sub and I still felt like shit. Finally got myself stabilized (mostly) after 24mg. I’ve never had to take that much before! I was only shooting maybe .1-.2/day before that too. Next day I think I took a full 8, then maybe 4 yesterday. Didn’t feel like I needed any today, I’m sure I would’ve taken probably 2mg and felt fine but I had a shot of dope (actually felt a .1 shot with that much sub in me but only for a minute, you know how it goes). 

So the question I guess is, anyone else have to take an insane amount of sub like that to get well after using such small amounts? I could see 16mg maybe but I was still totally sick until I got up to 24. Got right back down to my usual 2-4mg in a couple days afterward but that first sick day it took soo much to get well. 

… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … 
… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … 

TL;DR - anyone ever clench their jaw during an OD? anyone ever have to take a ton of sub (24mg+) just to get well after shooting only a couple points a day?",1528833552.0

It cost him 20.00 USD for 2 grams so I posted at his place while we chased dragons all night.

Anyways, both of us only smoke we don't snort or inject anything, even #4 EC powder. I never noticed this until now, but I usually will run the resin drop along the foil by tilting it down a bit so it rolls and I move the flame to stay under the drop. I always did it this way and never thought otherwise. I just like the look of it, and the ritual of ""chasing the dragon"". My friend, however, creates a little crater toward the edge of the foil and drops his dose into it like a bucket on the end of a little stick. he lights it underneath it's location on the foil, per usual. 

My question: Is there any advantage to smoking dope off foil using one method over the other? 

I tried both and maybe I am oblivious because I don't know what I am looking for, but I didn't notice a difference. You could save a lot more tin foil if you didn't roll it across the entire foil like a roadway though...",1528833305.0

my brother is doing 1-2 eightballs of coke a day and is lashing out at everyone, his boyfriend is cheating on him and when I tried to tell him this he kicked me out, which isn't bad but I am living with my ex girlfriend and best friend and now we are both displaced

My mom is in an open relationship with the ass hole I've seen her with for years, I've seen him hit her and attack her car with a crowbar and now she's okay with him fucking some other bitch. she just has to know everything that is going on. (A lot to digest)

My grandpa is bipolar and has a reputation of abandoning my grandmother who is a cancer survivor and a diabetic... the tension in my family has cause them to isolate themselves from everyone to the point where my grandpa has to throw temper tantrums on the phone screaming at people only to have him being very friendly upon walking through the door to greet him. my grandmother, has taken to drinking every night... to the point where she is passed out at the table, slurring her words as I say goodbye to walk home.

My father has been absent since he came out as gay when I was 11 and since then he has tried to live his own life and pretty much abandoned me and my brother to chase dick... now that I am in college for computer science (which I am paying for myself, which sucks because I cannot afford this next semester) thinks he can step in as the father figure after he lived off of my grandparents  (mom's parents) for the past 7 years rent free and now that he 's on his own he feels all  high and mighty and is trying to be my father. 

My ex girlfriend is a wonderful soul and I am so attached to her I don't want to even think about anyone else with her but I don't know if her and I want the same thing anymore.

My boss has heard how everything is going and is offering me a house that I can rent from him, because he sees a lot of himself in me and when I confronted my mom about it she says she doesn't want me to leave.

I've been dealing with substance abuse (benzos and opiates since I was a freshman) I've never been physically addicted before this long as bender... I can't remember if it was weeks or months since I went more than a few days without doing a line or popping a perc... 

This past week I realized when I wasn't using my 30's or sniffing cheese I was anxious as fucking and could not sleep and had bad RLS....

Opiates are the only thing that make me feel like I'm actually normal... I enjoy not having anxiety, or having ibs issues, not sweating, not second guessing everything I say, being confident, nor feeling like I'm freezing to death... but I'm at my 4th day clean. I'm over the worse part I think as I can get out of bed. thank god for clonidine and Robinul. I am scared I have ruined my ability to enjoy my DOC ever again. at such a young age. it's all my fault. I am beyond depressed and feel like I  let everyone down. my ex is horrified for me because I am in so much pain and lethargic and she is too naive to identify WD symptopms. 

how long will it he before I can use again without resetting this hell? I'm going to be clean for at least a month and working on my self control as well as coping mechanisms. when there is just so much going on it is just bliss to be able to sniff a 30 and be able to just focus on my job or class... any input is appreciated. thank you guys and gals so much...

But we all relate to being arrested or at the very least, avoiding cops because of the contents of our pockets! I just wondered if anybody has any thoughts about [the story in the UK from yeaterday.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/11/epileptic-boys-mother-barred-from-bringing-cannabis-oil-into-uk)


A mother was prescribed cannabis oil for her critically sick child with epilepsy. The seizures WILL kill him. But this oil made from the plant has altogether stopped the seizures and kept him well. Doctor in the UK prescribed it.. Doctor in Canada sold it because it is medicinal and legal. It was confiscated at the UK border because it contains a small amount of THC which is illegal. (It's mostly CBD if I remember rightly - the other chemical in weed that is not psychoactive, it won't get you high, but it helps with anxiety and other conditions - like epilepsy, obviously).

-

This has made me so angry. The war on drugs is fucking pathetic, outdated, unwinnable and has wasted lives, money, time and the progress against serious medical issues like depression, epilepsy, PTSD, addiction.. - All these things are strongly anecdotally aided by various illegal drugs (ketamine for depression, ibogaine/LSD for addiction, MDMA for PTSD, mushrooms for migraine and serious depression etc etc the list goes on and on) Yet science hasn't moved forward in more than 50 years because it's illegal to look at these substances, even in a controlled setting. The pharma industry could have developed non psychoactive versions of any of these drugs by now or worked out their method of action within the brain. Instead, we're decades behind because we've prohibited everything about them - which hasn't stopped a single person that ever wanted to do drugs, from ever doing them!

Drug dealers are like the Hydra. You cut one off, you get two spring up.
I've been sitting waiting for my dealer while reading the local paper about how 5 dealers were caught and sentenced in my city. One of them WAS my dealer. He said he was going to co to use making money until he goes to prison for under a year probably, but sell his phone with all the customers to so.eo e to take over. Not a single break in the chain.

-

Anyway. As we are discovering, one of these illegal drugs is also one of the most medicinal plants ever. (The hippies were right, who knew!).

From epilepsy to cancer. Change the balance of THC to CBD and you get great appetite enhancer for people struggling to eat after chemo.  Or anti anxiety.. Weed genuinely seems to be pretty miraculous for a number of serious conditions.

It's pretty much a certainty at this point. So,while we wait for the law to catch up. This mother may have to watch her son for because the law says this plant has incorrectly been deemed illegal and there is no talk of changing the law, despite the benefits. This story will hopefully bring more attention to the subject. But I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the government to make a positive change. They're scared shirtless to change drug policy and it's the most cowardly thing any of those politician fucks can do. **Science says 100% to do this... They won't because they're too scared of how they'll look in the eyes of their right wing supporters.  Meanwhile, BILLIONS in untaxed illegal drug currency flows out the country, people die due to science being unable to pursue any psychoactive a (See: 2016 COMPLETE BAN ON ALL PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS, INCLYDING ONES THAR HAVENT BEEN INVENTED YET!

FYI, this idiotic law saw a 600% increase in hospital admissions because research chemicals were suddenly illegal, people had to turn to the street where they didn't know what they were getting or the dose. Jumping on a gap in the market, dealers started selling Spice - which then TOOK OVER the homeless community (endless news stories about it) with people dying, seizures and getting addicted to it with many addicts saying it is even harder to come off than crack and heroin)

I insisted that out of fear I had flushed them down one of the toilets. Got grounded for 2 months (everything stripped from my room. School then home to nothing). I did not die, as a matter of fact, all I felt was a very irritating itch everywhere. I'm not trying to bullshit as I have almost died on 600mg of PMA so I know how immortal I am not.

Incredibly tired of disappointing my parents and this life I live, yet the main reason is really only because I can’t afford the dope where I’m currently at. 

I’ve wasted the last 9 years of my life to this shit. But I can’t stop for more than 2-3 days. I can’t express any emotion and I can’t ask for help. I’m just stubborn like that. I don’t want to admit defeat yet again, but I’m at the lowest point of my life. My parents aren’t stupid, they know what’s up, but neither of us will admit what’s going on again. 

I have severe depression and thoughts of suicide regularly. I’m livingout of my car and am lonely af. No family in the state, no friends either. Idk who to talk to or even where to begin. Everybody I do talk to only uses my openess against me. Nobody really actually cares. It’s all a facade. 

I’m So far gone and so fucking lost. It’s incredibly hard for me to see a future for me, and if there is one I don’t see dope leaving for good. Fml. I hate myself. I hate that this substance has such a strong hold on me. I hate how fucking expensive it is. 

I’m like a walking contradiction. I want to be normal but if I could I would just use and use and use. I want to make my momma proud, but I’m a selfish asshole who only
Thinks about me and my next hit. 

If anybody actually read all this shit and feels like talking or has any words of wisdom or anything please PM a bro. I’m going insane sitting/living/getting high/WD in my House(my car). I just want to take a shower and sit on a couch and chill with somebody. But I have nobody. ",1528773368.0

(Hijack their connect),"So I just got back into the game after a good 6-8 month break but since I've been on break my dealer went into treatment. Well I've been trying to find a connect for a while and it didn't go very well in the beginning. First off, I was able to find a dude who was willing to help me out finding some good ECP (in my area it's actually hard to come by and more expensive). The only problem was he was charging me $20 extra which made half G's cost $90 bucks!! Wayyy to expensive but it was all I had access to and since my tolerance is so low, it lasted long enough where the $90 wasn't that big of a deal breaker.

 Well, of fucking course the jackass ends up robbing me (I gave him the cash and after 20 min of waiting he said he got pulled over and blah, blah, blah. I knew he was lying instantly because if you get caught with dope or rigs, since he was a shooter, you're going to jail and not for just one night because he hit me up the next day saying he'd ""get me back for the $90 eventually but if I wanted to grab again he could help me out""). So there goes that connection, luckily for the 2/3 weeks he helped me grab I was able to get 2 numbers from him. One was his ECP connect (got the number because one night he was sick and needed a point and I told him I'd only help if I could get the connect). Well he must have known his connect was changing numbers or something because that connect changed numbers like 4/5 days after I got the number (I was able to call the dude 2 days in a row but he just kept saying he didn't have any and he'd let me know when he did... after he asked 20 questions about how I got his number).

On to the main reason of this post... Well the other number I got was some chick who could help me find tar, but she wasn't a dealer, just a middle. I picked up with her a few times but she was the greediest middle ever. First time I grabbed they picked up the dope and shaved off 2 points of my half gram (I said **I** could break off at most a point for her but off course she  broke it off). Well, I decided to buy grams after that so I didn't have to break off as much for them (her and her bf) but of fucking course she wanted 2 points if I bought grams.

I argued with her about it but I couldn't do anything about it because I didn't have any connects yet so I had to deal with getting basically ripped off (especially considering I had to drive 40 min to her place, only to drive her and her bf 20 min back towards my crib where her connect was to pick up).

After 2 weeks of this shit.... constantly trying to get the connect from her, telling her I'd pay for it, etc .... I decide I need to get the connects number. The chick who was helping me would always have her bf come with us to grab and they would always keep telling me that ""you're not breaking off enough"" and would sit there until I gave them what **they** considered to be 2 points off my gram. Well, one day it was just me and the girl and we went to pick up at some restaurant.

This was my chance. I wrote my number on a note and slipped it into the cash... after I counted it out for her. The note read ""Yo, I've been going through Jane Doe for a month now but she's ripping me off. Here's my number, hit me up so I can buy straight from you"".

I didn't expect to hear back but literally 2 min later the chick got a text from her dude. I'm thinking ""oh fuck, I'm screwed"" but he just asked her if I was sketchy, if I'm cool, etc... She was sketched out wondering why he was asking questions and I just said it's probably because he saw me looking at him when you grabbed. Well, 2 min later I get a text from the dude saying I can buy straight from him now!! Later that day he asked if I broke her off some and I told him I always did (and not just a point, but upwards of 2 points).  I told him not to tell her I got his number a few times, and he said he wouldn't......lol

Well, later during the day my phone started getting blown up by the chick. Apparently she was trying to get the dude to give her a few points because she told him I didn't give her anything (which was BS because I gave her easily 2 points this last time because I got the dudes number and was like ""fuck it, here is the last dope you'll get from me"" lol). The connect messaged me and apologized because he told her that he knows I gave her a few points off that gram. So I have to go into damage control mode (just in case I need to grab from her again since she had a few connects)..... I told the chick I never talked to the dude and kinda convinced her that he was lying because ""how could I get his number?"" and ""he's probably just saying that so he doesn't have to break you off any"". Luckily, I also told her I was taking a break for a few weeks after I picked up (this is after I got the connects number, so I was essentially breaking it off with her) so hopefully she stops messaging me (she constantly hits me up asking if I want to pick up again.. Like less than 24 hours after getting a gram). 

FUCK yeah, I was so tired of all the BS I had to put up with going through  that chick and her bf. They were heavy users and that's one reason they were constantly asking me to break off more... to the point where a few times I honestly told them that I'm not giving them any more. As a bonus, I was able to haggle my prices down to $120 a gram (the chick was getting charged $140 because she would never ask for lower prices, and she would get points from her dude for bringing him business so she didn't give a fuck what someone like me paid).

Another bonus... This connect is only 20 min away and is legit. We talked a bit when I first grabbed from him and he hates the girl who was helping me out because she's such a fiend. She constantly tries to score points for bringing him $20 sales and his rule is 1 point for 1 gram sales.

TL;Dr
Chick who was middling for me was a fiend, asking for 1/5 of the dope i purchased. After putting up with her shit for a month I snuck my number and a note in the cash to her connect asking for him to hit me up. And it worked. Also, now I pay $20 less and don't have to drive extra to pick up.

Moral of the story: don't be a greedy middle because people will find a way around you (a point off a gram would have been cool with me and I would have continued to grab through her for a while, but asking for 1/5 of my bag is just greedy).",1528771917.0

8qejsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8qejsl/is_there_a_better_more_silent_less_messy_way_to/,21,https://redd.it/8qejsl,rotarimonolog,"is there a 'better' (more silent, less messy) way to vape H rather than foil?","Hi! Been chasing the dragon for a few years, am now a certified professional with virtually no wastage, can even do it all with one hand if given a lighter that has a lock mode. 

Problem: let's face it, it's not ideal. Amongst many drawbacks, i can think of the following:

a) it involves foil. Stories claim that it might be dangerous, other that it's an urban legend. Truth is, if you ever vaped meth from foil then from glass (oil pipe), you know it tastes 100&#37; better in the pipe. So why take the risk?

b) foil is noisy. Trying to unwrap your crumped up foil in the toilet, desperately insuring its fairly smooth while getting paranoid about smoke detectors is sub\-optimal to say the least.

c) it's not convenient. Spending time\-pre\-cutting sheets and stashing them in a book for easy access, carrying foil on you which makes 0 sense and might raise attention, having to buy 'just foil and a coke please at the supermarket' \- well you get my drift.

d) it's dirty. Oh yes, we've all been there, one false move and you touched the underside where the lighter was, voila, black fingers. Now you're trying to wash your hands, but just leaving the foil on top of the table made the table dirty... its' endless.

So... surely there's a better way. I know evidently i could just buy H4 but in the UK where i'm from, H4 is essentially 99&#37; of the time a fent analogue, and i love my life. Mainlining is not a step i wish to take at the moment, and i don't think needles are particularly much more convenient either.

I'm been thinking of carrying a glass surface and chase on that, leveraging a stronger heat source (torch lighter). The problem is that normal glass shatters easily, and the pyrex stuff doesn't come in thin enough, or flat enough containers to be convenient carried.

I've tried oil pipes (meth pipes), no dice, that's essentially either: a) wasting product as the heat is applied evenly to the whole of the product, wasting much of it by heating parts of it way too much, and other not enough, or b) essentially 'boiling it' over , creating a nasty, hyper heated fume that's as impossible as it is  dangerous to breath.

One thing i thought might have some legs is a metal cylinder, roughly 1cm wide, meaning wide enough to sprinkle h within, but also not wide enough to prevent using as an 'all in one device'. Sadly, i had little luck with this, as when i tried the H, if not evenly distributed, would evidently 'roll' and 'aggregate' within the pipe, and eventually either drop down on the floor, or ... dangerously make its way down towards my mouth.. no thanks. The idea came from how you can easily re\-heat any tooter and essentially burn the accumulated resin within it. I guess a mechanism by which little notch prevent the h to roll down when heated or accumulate too much in clumps is imaginable, but it would be rather... specialized hardware. 

I'm out of ideas, so if you have any and had luck with them, let us know! Bonus points if it involves an 'all in one (pipe\-like) device.

Except a few times friends  gave me a pill here and there  (no idea what they were sorry but was told ""they're good"") but taking 1 each time always sucked and just made me a little tired. I was also prescribed tramadol one time and took 3x my dose and it made me feel like one jolly fella! I have bad anxiety and my fav thing about weed is it just makes me forget about the world for a while but I've heard opiates are like that, but 10x better so Idk. I've taken many psychs, molly, and everything else besides opiates, crack, and meth. 

So a few very basic questions (please don't patronize me or make me feel like I'm going to spiral out of control and be a junkie). I plan to take 1 substance 1 time and flush the rest and I won't be able to obtain anymore from my future source to be extra safe. That's even if I have the balls to try it.

I have found a way to get my hands on either H or 30mg oxy (I think they say K 9?) And I want to know:

1. Which is a good starter for 1 time opiate experience? H (not IV) or oxy? 

2. What's a good dose? Not a baby dose, but enough that I can see what opiates are all hyped about and not worry about OD?

3. If I did try H, what is the best route of administration that's NOT IV?

Sorry for the novice post, just trying to be safe and you guys are the experts.

***EDIT: I guess starting with H is sounding more dumb as I think about it and read this. I just wanted a good kick and I've heard of ppl like smoking it on accident and never wanted to do it again so I figured it was okay. Thanks for all your help guys!",1528759626.0

I always forget my login and password so I make new alts all the time. 

I’ve been clean since January 3rd but before this my main doc was opana er 40s.     G74s 

So I still talk to many of my friends/using buddies/whatever the fuck you wanna call em. Well my buddy was looking to buy some opanas of the dark web (which we used to do often for the g74s) and said that the only ones he can find are the stop signs. Which in my head is a red flag because to my knowledge they stopped production of these in 2012 when they switched to the g series. So. 

Q#1- Are stop signs still sold in other countries that the u.s and there is a possibility these are legitimate oxymorphone? 

While researching this I came across this article
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-opana-er-opioid-painkiller-pulled-from-the-market-by-fda/ 
Which is an article stating that in 2017 the fda approached the makers of opana er (I believe this is the g series) and asked them to stop making them and the company followed the fdas “recommendation” 
So now this leads me to 

Q#2 Are opana g series still even available in the United States to get as a prescription? And if not are they available in other countries?

I know these pills have always been hard to come by without a consistent plug of them, but I know every plug for them I have/had is now gone or doesn’t sell these and as switched over to selling Roxie’s or dope. Is this the reasoning? 

TLDR: just read the q1 & 2.

So I waited 24 hours after my last dose and even though I wasn't really that sick I decided to IV about 2 mg of my zubsolv. Instant precipitated withdrawals. Great, I've been through this a couple of times so I immediately recognized it and decided the only way to fix this was by getting some dope and rx opiates in me. Had my plug drop it off between the doors and booted up a .2.. felt much better but not 100% so I convinced my pops to give me 3 opana 20mg ERs (g72s I think).

 Sniffed one, ok feeling better still not 100% so let's try this iso extraction method again. I have the crushed up pill sitting in a hundred mg of ISO and had to take my dogs out so I let it sit for a while by the time I was able to come back to it all of the alcohol had dissolved and I was left with clumps of oxymorphone soaked in iso. added 100mL of iso and used a spare rig/cotton to pull up about 85mL of iso/oxymorphone liquid. Poured into a new cooker and slowly boiled away all of the ISO. Was left with a tiny bit of white residue. Added water and drew up in a new syringe. Booted up and felt nothing again but my receptors were still bound by the bupe.

I think I'm doing everything right and I still think I'd rather have a 40 of dope than 3 opana 40s with their current formulation. I like getting my shit, turning into the nearest lot, and booting up. My wife is sober/never used before so I have to hide everything from her. It's just not feasible to scoop them then run into my cave and start a 20 minute minimum process to get high. Props to you guys making it work, but I think a few of you should try and find a dboy connect if your not prescribed them or are paying full retail (50 bucks each 40mg in my block).

i feel i have been living in a fantasy being romantically involved with someone i met in a massive group chat on facebook in august. weve been talking for almost a year. i didnt want a relationship, i didnt want anyone in my bubble, but he came along. hes younger than me, and i remember being his age. hes been using as long as i have, but hes 19 and im almost 24. it makes me feel somehow predatory, though; what if i damage him? i am not good at relationships. i am so insecure that i just destroy them because all i do is cry. i get so overwhelmed by the negativity that i start to feel about being in love - is it like that for everyone? arent you just supposed to be blissful when youre in love? 

he relapsed on tar, and lied to me bout how long he had been using for and how much he had been spending. we had been planning and i have been working around 60 hours a week for a month or so saving and preparing financially for him to come. i told him that all i want is for him to have his drivers license, ~$150-200 for his half of the plane ticket price, and ~$250-300 for entertainment purposes. this is a significantly lesser amount of money than i need to save in order for me to feel comfortable taking this vacation. i just want him to meet me half way and have some spending money. i sugar mama everybody, so i wasnt really trippin, but i noticed that he wouldnt do simple things and always came up with excuses as to why certain steps hadnt been accomplished on his end. all i do is work and i wanted to have a vacation for my birthday. i feel disappointed, but i feel like somehow i dont deserve to be disappointed because ultimately i should have known better. 

he does some things that make me feel like i am being manipulated, but it makes me feel confused because i feel as though i am the one who is supposed to be more responsible for the relationship/his well being because i am older. i guess i feel like this because ive always been the younger one in my relationships. but for instance, i have a bad habit if running away. i have a free spirit and i need to let my nomadic/wanderlust tendencies out. not that im not loyal; i just need my space to be wholly involved in my own self/identity. it took me a long time to rebuild my identity after my ex. i lost myself completely to trying to help him be clean and finally breaking and just using alongside him because i just wanted it to kill me, i felt i couldnt escape. so my identity is important. anyway, i tend to get scared and i want to shut everybody out because im convinced they hate me sometimes - i did a little run away stint and ghosted him at the beginning of our relationship and he made me feel so bad about it that i felt like i couldnt get any space. since becoming more and more involved with him, it feels now like he treats me as though i am clingy, and becomes angry if he thinks im not giving him space. im just lost and confused and i miss myself and i have been feeling like i am living in an extended month long flashback. 

the night he supposedly relapsed (or at least admitted it) i had fallen asleep and my phone was on silent because i hate noisy phones. he called me like 49 times and texted me over 100. the result of this was his relapse. 

i cannot escape how much guilt i feel even though i know i shouldnt. i am terrified. i dont have the strength to fight this battle again. i fought my exs addiction until i died inside and i can feel myself dying again. i never thought id have my fuck it moment again. 

i find it ironic that somehow an oxy was acceptable but the stigma of switching to heroin feels so much more foreboding. 

i think what scares me most of all is looking at the 20s i pick up and thinking it would be so much more worth it if i had a needle to shoot it with.",1528738740.0

I know what I've done to my body. I also know that right now every step is agony and makes it hurt to breathe.

I can't take opiates in moderation. I love the euphoria, but mostly because it was the signal that relief was on its way. 

So I'm on subs and Tylenol and I'm 37 years old. I cannot feel like this for the next 40 years. I feel like my entire body is on fire, and its my legit pain that I was originally scripted for. I can't lift my youngest to change his diaper. I can't even lift him into a grocery cart.

I got to the point where I was shooting my legit dilaudid script and got heroin to help me make it through appointments. Not to be high - but to function as a mother and wife. 

I knew I had to try something different because I was heading downhill, so I'm on the subs. They're great for craving avoidance and making withdrawal bearable, but they don't touch my pain.

I can't live with the opiates.
I can't function without them.

I'm feeling really lost and discouraged. I just cannot imagine feeling like this for the rest of my life. If I have to, it won't be a long one. 

The desire to avoid and fix pain is as old as humanity itself. We're evolved to avoid pain -- pain is our bodies way of telling us something is wrong. But what happens if your brain tells you that something as simple as your kids gentle hug will feel like being beaten with a pillowcase full of bricks instead?

Will my pain ever recede? Is this my body trying to recalibrate what normal pain feels like?

I just know that I refuse to feel like this for the rest of my life. I don't want to be a junkie. I just want to be a mom that can get down on the ground and play barbies without wanting to weep in agony when it's time to get up.

Thanks for reading my whiny-pants post. Any advice is welcome.",1528736028.0

I’ve been using heroin IV for 5 months now, pretty hardcore binge, 3/4 bags per day.

Planning to detox, going for 2 weeks in a place where I have no access to dope.

I have:
• 4 mg subutex 
• 20gr kratom 
• 30 days worth Lyrica 150mg
• 30 days worth Clonidine 150mg 
• a few tramadol 100mg
• a few Ativan 
• a few Xanax 
• a few Methocarbamol (muscle relaxant)

I had my last dose this morning (12AM).

When to start my meds and at which pace?

Taking the 4mg Subu is pointless, it means just dragging the wd to the day after (if not more); so I’m planning to skip it.

I will try to wait until tomorrow morning, once I wake up:

9AM
• 2 spoons of Kratom + 300mg Lyrica + 150 Clonidine

15PM
• 1 spoon of Kratom + 300mg Lyrica 

22PM
• 0.5 xanax + muscle relaxant 

I would keep it like this for 3 days and then start to taper the lyrica and the Xanax; I would use an antihistamine for sleep and avoid benzos.

What do you think about dosage/timings ? Shall I include the subutex ?

My most pronounced problems are:
• RLS + restlessness in general 
• lack of motivation / depression 
• anxiety 
• sleep 

I usually don’t have huge problems with stomach and nausea.

Any tip or experience is very much appreciated.

I’ve been taking pills for almost two years. About halfway through that period of time my brother moved in with me (after my ex moved out). He’s younger, but he has his shit together wayy more so than I do. Anyway, he’s basically unknowingly supported my habit. Every time I ran out of money he would help. He would encourage me to start budgeting my money better, but he never demanded any more than that. Car got repossessed a couple months ago, he helped me get it back. He’s been there for me at every turn. 

Over the past couple months I felt his suspicion growing. “Why is this dude working 80 hours a week at two different jobs but he’s still always broke..?” I guess he gave me the benefit of the doubt. He had no idea what a lying scumbag I’d become. Had no idea I was using his half of the rent to buy pills. I would always intend to replace the money, but with more money came more pills. As they say, the road to hell was paved with good intentions. 

Anyway, a couple days ago he found out we were on the verge of being evicted. I had a payment arrangement worked out with our landlord. No need for my brother to know. But.. people talk. Landlord’s wife works with my boss’ girlfriend. Small town shit. Loose lips, etc. My brother finds out we’re behind and demands that I lay my cards on the table and explain myself. I decided it was time. No more lies. No more web weaving. This is it. Now or fucking never. 

I told him *everything*. Thought I’d have a damn panic attack. But we got through it. He felt so bad for what I’ve been through that he could barely even be mad at me. Now.. he’s helping me quit. All my money has to be accounted for. I’m on a taper plan to ween myself off the pills. He has me on a short leash. It may sound crazy, but honestly, I think it’s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. 

A couple weeks from now I’ll be done. It’s gonna be tough. I’m gonna have to make myself start up better habits, etc. Gonna have to get my mind right. But. I can do it. I have support now. I have this burden off my chest and out in the open. I cannot possibly express how good that feels. To have someone on my team. It’s not me versus the world anymore. 

Wish me luck. I know I can do this. Prayers, good vibes, whatever you believe in - I would appreciate it. This group has provided a lot of information and knowledge for me over the past couple years. I feel like it’s helped me to stay safe, and kept me from feeling like I was all alone in the world. For that I’d like to thank each of you. 

I don’t judge anyone who still actively uses any substance. Not at all. We all have a path to follow. This happens to be mine. This happens to be the best thing for me, and I’m excited to see it through. 


TL;DR - My brother / room mate found out about my pill habit. Found out he was basically funding my bs for the past two years. He’s helping me stay positive while I ween off the pills and get better. Wish me luck. Thanks for being there when I wouldn’t let anyone else in. Love and blessings to all of you. ",1528714816.0

I’m gonna try to keep this as short and concise as possible, but I have a tendency to tell stories that are longer than they need to be, so I apologize in advance. So the first time I took this mystery substance, my roxy plug was all out of blues, so I bought ‘percs’ from him that ended up being fake. They weren’t pressed though, once I took a closer look it was like someone had scraped off the outer layer of a perc with the markings on it and somehow attached it to this pill, I guess the inner part was pressed I don’t know. Because when I got it again last night, I was under the impression that I was buying h, so this time it was in rock/powder form. So the rocks and powder were brown with very few white speckles. I’ve actually gotten dope that looked just like it before that was really good. This time, when I crushed the rocks they didn’t exactly turn into powder, it’s really hard to explain but the best I can do is to say it was *almost* sticky. Like it turned into a flat piece that I kinda had to break up with my fingers, almost like breaking up weed. I’ve also gotten dope that was like this before, and it was some of the best stuff I’ve ever had, so I was excited. The fake percs were completely white. So the first time I did some this time was last night, but I didn’t do a whole lot and I noticed I felt kind of anxious and not at all tired, but I still had some left of my last batch, so I figured the new stuff was just not as strong, so I did some of the old stuff and went to sleep. Fast forward to today, I did a pretty decent sized rock when I got to work, and that’s when I realized I had come across the same stuff as whatever was in those fake percs, which I also had happened to take right before work that time too. So here are the effects. It starts out feeling like I smoked weed. When I say ‘the percs’ from here on out, I’m referring to the fake ones of course, and then I’ll probably refer to the stuff I was given last night as ‘this stuff’ or something along those lines. So the percs first kicked in when I was driving, and I don’t really smoke weed anymore, but it felt like it used to when I would drive high on weed. And then when it really kicked in full on while I was at work (bartending), I had the anxiety/paranoia and awkwardness/lack of social skills that I experience when I smoke now that I hardly ever do and have lost my tolerance. Luckily, I could do my job in my sleep because I wasn’t able to think straight, so the things that I do every day that are like muscle memory I was able to do just fine. But I remember from the time with the percs, there was a drink that I’ve made enough times that I should know how to make it but not enough times that it’s second nature, and I could not for the life of me remember how to make it and as I was figuring it out, I kept doing things in the wrong order and stuff like that. Another major symptom that will hopefully help to identify this is that both times, I kept feeling like there was something under my shirt (the first time) and in my teeth/on my tongue (the second time) that I was trying to grab and pull off but it was never really there. I mean I could absolutely feel it there for sure like almost sharp and poking me but when I would try to grab it there was nothing there. The time with the percs I must have taken a lot more because it was a lot more intense and lasted longer. I was getting very confused about things and having trouble communicating with people and felt like everyone was staring at me and knew that I was on something. That still happened with this stuff but it was a lot less intense. So that along with almost feeling like I was high on weed and feeling things that weren’t there were the main symptoms. What does this sound like to y’all? It didn’t make me tired, but I didn’t really feel like I had a whole bunch of energy. Also I know in the title I said not a picture, but I do have some left, so if anyone wants to see I can try and figure out how to post a picture, I’ve just never done it before. So sorry this was so long! If y’all have any questions let me know :) and thank you for reading and for possibly helping me! :)

But, the important thing for this to succeed is for all my fellow addicts to *stay alive*. Seriously, the prohibitionists want you all to die so there will be fewer voices against it. Stay alive, stay out of jail, and take care of yourself. If you want to do opiates that's fine but take care of yourself and show your community that you're a good-hearted individual and not a cruel junkie.

For the past year or so, I’ve had a somewhat regular supply of 10mg Percs, which are my faves, and 10mg generic hydrocodone. I also have “diagnosed” add and have had an Adderall script for almost 8 years. My doctor hasn’t increased the dosage in like 6 years though, and as we all know, tolerance is a b, so in order for my Adderall to really work for me, I’m taking approximately 2x the prescribed amount, thus running out early, fml, etc, etc., 
I’m rambling though so I’ll get to the point regarding the opiates...
Depending upon my ability to obtain them, I may be on them a week or more, then off a week or less with the number of pills capping out (at most) at 7 a day, though on a good day I may only eat 5 or less and it’s also relative to my Adderall supply. My question is-
is extreme fatigue and lethargy on off days the norm? Reading online it isn’t really a major withdrawal symptom, so I don’t know if I cant attribute the tiredness to that, but they give me the most amazing motivation and energy and day one without I’m seriously zombie mode. 
I don’t think my usage is to the point to where serious withdrawal symptoms occur, (i have had minor muscle aches and RLS but definitely nothing unbearable) which is why the total lack of energy thing is kind of concerning me, because it’s my most noticeable symptom yet the one I see listed lease online.

Just wondering if it’s normal because as of now, the percs are more beneficial to my productivity and motivation than my actual add meds, which just makes me paranoid I have some undiagnosed terminal illness. Or something.

They let me live with them if I stayed clean and they were giving me a home drug test every 2-3 days at different times of the day. I've been staying clean because I knew I'd be caught if I relapsed, and I was trying to save my money to move out first. 

I asked them if they'd take me to a sub doctor because I was struggling and my mom thought that meant I relapsed because her internet research told her subs aren't for people who are clean and her cult AA family support group probably told her the same. My brother was barely a chipper and he quit with no problems. He told my parents months after they found out about me that he used to get high with me too but he's clean. They think because he did it cold turkey without wd or any help that it's easy and I can't do it because I'm not ""taking recovery seriously"". Long story short, my mom was convinced I wasn't clean anymore because I asked to use subs.

This morning I called in sick to work because I haven't been sleeping well and I couldn't think straight. I've been working 60-70 hours a week and I needed a break. I sat on the porch to have my coffee and I fell asleep. My mom woke me up and started yelling at me for nodding out on the porch and for scaring her because she thought I od'ed again. 

I walked to my second job in the evening to get away from the house and when I came home she went through all my things. She found a needle cap in my car and a empty bag in my old jacket that I don't wear anymore. Both of those are from before I got clean and it's reasonable that they got lost and I forgot about them. My dad tried to back me up but he takes my moms side in arguments in the end. They didn't even care if I offered to pass a drug test because of I'm ""cheating them"" somehow yeah? So they kicked me out and stopped talking to me again and I immediately relapsed because fuck it. 

I was planning to get my own place and relapse then when I could enjoy it in my own apartment and feel like I deserved it. Instead I'm staying with a friend and shooting up in a walmart bathroom because he'll kick me out if I bring anything to his place. Fuck man even if you try sometimes you just can't win.

I've been on 6mg subs for two weeks and it has been good, my life wasn't in tatters before starting subs and my habit was relatively recent (half a year ish). I was using at least 0.5 of H at the very least 3-5 days a week beforehand. 

**I have decided I am going to try get high today no matter what. I do very much appreciate any concerns about interfering with my maintenance but it's happening regardless.** Whether this takes me putting a mountain of powder up my nose or having my friend hit me; **it's happening**.

My last dose of 6mg suboxone was 12 hours ago (and it is 9am here, won't be picking up till later and could wait till the evening to make it 24+ hours). 

Thus I would appreciate any advice regarding dosage differentials (even if approximate). If 0.1-0.2 insufflated got me high before the 6mgs of sub; how much should I insufflate on the sub? Lets say I had my friend hit me to better break through, how much should I have him load up? 

If I manage to get high today (full agonist binding achieved), I should obviously be skipping my suboxone dose tonight, but if I didn't, would I go into precipitated WDs?

Any advice is much appreciated.

I've only ever snorted coke before, so if I snorted it this would be my first time snorting an opiate. And if I boofed it, this would be my first time boofing, period. 

I know the intranasal bioavailability of oxymorphone is 43% and the rectal bioavailability is 50.7%, so if I boof it I am getting slightly more bang for my buck. But which will be a better high?

I usually do oxy*codone* and when I do, I only take it orally. However, that's never given me the famous opiate ""rush"" I hear everyone talking about. From what I understand, you have to snort or IV to get the rush. Is that true? What about if you boof it?

Basically, I've been an occasional user of prescription opiates ever since I found an old bottle of vicodin in my parents' cabinet when I was a teen. I've been a regular pot smoker ever since around that time too, and I'm in my late twenties now, but despite trying all sorts of drugs I've never formed an addiction to anything besides my habitual (daily) smoking of the weed. Though I love the feeling I get from opiates, I knew that it was a dangerous game and I never escalated past the occasional painkiller that I'd come across (couple of surgeries, scripts from friends surgeries, etc) maybe a few times a year max. I'd never gone out of my way to purchase them on the street or anything, and no one in my social circle is a regular user (at least not that I'm aware of).

... Until this year. Be it a combination of boredom, depression about my employment/life situation, yearning for the feeling again, spending too much time browsing this sub, and figuring out that you can find oxy connects on craigslist, whatever reason you'd like to ascribe, I made my first street opiate transaction and got blues for the first time. Basically, I got a 10pack went on a little bender for a week before taking a month break. I definitely noticed that it was hard for me to keep away from them when I had them in my possession, but I knew enough to stay away from buying them again too soon, and honestly I didn't want to. I had no interest in becoming a physically-dependent opiate addict.

This was almost 6 months ago and honestly not much about my use has changed. I'm not buying ten packs, usually it's about 3 at a time, and maybe once every other week. I have kept it on a schedule where I have never once experienced physical withdrawal symptoms.  I do not feel that I rely on the pills, and I have turned my life around in terms of finding purpose, figuring out an employment situation that makes me happy, and I've never been more in love with my partner. Though, they do not know about my secret indulgence. That's honestly what gives me the most guilt--keeping this all hidden from them when I'm partaking. But usually, I take the drugs when they're not around because I love being high and giving myself some quality alone time. 

So, am I just a foolish idiot? I love opiates and I want to keep doing them because... well, I love them and the feeling they give me. I know that I don't want to go broke/into debt because of them, I know that I want to practice safe harm-reduction like using fentanyl test strips on new batches, and I definitely know that I don't want to get to the point where my body needs the oxy to feel okay. And I feel really confident in myself that I can keep this up. But like a lot of people, I read the posts on this sub about ""chipping being impossible"" and ""it's only a matter of time"" and a little part of me worries.

**TL;DR:** I've been chipping oxy for almost half a year now and I don't feel my life spiraling out of control. In fact, it's getting better. What's your take on what I'm doing?",1528652498.0

60 each of these. I thought he said $100 for 60? But this was like a year ago, tho I'm sure he's still around if he's alive. I just need to know. :P I mean I've heard of $1 a mg but these are dillies.

So,

> 2mg hydromorphone IR

> 1mg hydromophone XR
> 2mg hydromorphone XR

> and 2mg little injectable vials?? either 60 or $100 of those. 




###########################################################




I'm just curious at this point. I wonder if this guy is even still around.  Legs are a big concern. I heard dillies don't last very long??I remember snorting them with next to no tolerance and enjoying them for hours. IDK, heroin lasted VERY, VERY LONG when I was first doing it. Heck. When I was shooting I made one point into 3 needles~! Sometimes I shoot one in the evening and two the next day! Or vice-versa. 

I met this disabled guy. He was mocking someone, and I think he's making fun of some ""kid"" about morphine,..fuck, I just had to pop in( See the thing is....0_0 I was on a relapse, AND, like a man on the run, I knew I was going to end, I knew I was going to crash, but before I did,fueled by iv coke & heroin,  I wanted ""MORE"". More variety. I wanted to find ""THE BEST"". and thru socializing-actually spending time and getting to know various people, looking for dealers, and talking to all sorts of people, I mean... may be a dead end or may punch you people,..I had tried SO MANY different sources of dope,  ALL-FUCKING-WEEK-LONG) I got the number of a prostitute with green teeth, that I will never - ever talk to - she said if I ever ""you know need a release"" I can call- I got that just because she might actually have a hookup down the line. I went to areas I've never been, got high with people I've never met. 

I freaked out a dealer in a bathroom. Caught up with him. Told him I know what he was doing, but just chill ""I'm networking"" and showed him a big chunk of dope. He shows me a bag of little bags like so what. Then doesn't wait for me to go to the bank machine. 

I give a girl a pack of smokes I find on the bus to track him down. This is after asking 10 people at the library if they knew where he went. 

HE WAS SELLING IN THE CORNER OF A CORNER STORE~!! I WAS LIKE OK. TOOK MY SHIT. Gave chicky a point, ""What about the cashier""... ""Dude, of course they know"" 

3 people came up to him for hand to hand while I watched that. Days later when the relapse was over that side of the corner store had a massive flag hanging, hiding this guys ""corner spot"" heh. It was really a corner spot. A corner, in the corner store, on the corner :P 

Where I met the wheelchair dude was right outside of there. 

So this kid was actually bragging, saying he gets hydromorphone cause his Dad is in the H.A., which in Canada is such a lame thing to say, but it happens all the time. So wheelchair guy said we all know he's full of shit. And he clearly didn't even understand what the drug is. ""Trust me, I do, I mean, look at me"" and he sorta waves his wrist and gibbled hand"" He's in a wheelchair, his neck looks like it's in a weird sort of crook, his hand barely extends. 

Anyway, I ask him about his pain management. Quickly learn he only uses pot medicine cause it actually deals with the inflammation. He gets lots of hydromorphone but sells it all. 

Says sometimes WD decides who has first pick. I'd imagine he gets sob stories every month, even from those stocking up SHEESH.



I'd laugh if everything was $60 for 100 pills. I've gotten dillies for some weed a few times and sorted and plugged it. And bottles of morphine for free. ALL BEFORE I EVER SHOT ANYTHING.  I also took some percs. meaningless amount. I really wish I had more experience with pills. 

At the time I remember thinking, FUCK, that sure sounds cheap~!!! But I was at the end of a relapse and I had been caught and was off to treatment again. I'd love to get 10 of those once a month. Hell, even a few every weekend. 

I know he's not a phony. And I've kept his number all this time.

Second thought is school and such. Next step is spin cycle.,"I have a complex situation. It will be easier to boil it down so I'm not pushing all that reading on anyone. I was slipping(didn't use) in transitional housing. The executive director overruled kicking me out. And from that time I went above and beyond. tbh even the original stuff was mostly lead by a guy who was a bully who literally bullied my female case worker right before she quit. 

Anyway, I was told-after the executive director left. That getting some plastic in the organics(I volunteered for the grossest job, one of many things I did to show appreciation. And ""taking a tone, while being polite and not using bad language, I'll admit that"".

Was now grounds for me to be ""moved on"".
They wanted to send me downtown. Right where I used to call the best dealer I've ever known. I went into, I have tons of money saved up from EI, I""m going to fucking use so much dope. I'm so depressed, they're taring me out of my community. 

I DIDN'T EAT OR SLEEP MUCH FOR 2 DAYS. 
But I got thru it. I'm going to move 5 - 10 minutes away. Rent a room and share everything else. Stay in school, doing my upgrading in the same complex where I used to live. Stay in this area. Stay using WorkBC-for school funding for college-help. 

Use the non-profit temp agency. 

However. Being free from people watching over me has the fantasies coming back a lot. I keep thinking. So if I don't take my methadone for half a day, and then do dope. Then wait for withdrawal the next day, take methadone like normal. 

I keep running thru how I can use while still keeping my methadone carries and making it all work. I know this isn't what I'm supposed to do. But I feel like I'm being pushed from the community I know, a place where I didn't use cause I had to not use dope to stay. But I refuse to leave this area and go downtown to another 2nd stage. Especially a place that's no joke where I would phone my guy and then walk a number of blocks to meet him.

If things work out one of these things will happen.
-I will use off and on, maintain my methadone carries situation and it will be all good. 
-I will use off and on and it will all go to shit.
-I will concentrate on meditation and how I'm into fitness and being healthy and I'll weigh even more than 170lbs any day now.

You need to understand weighing 170lbs is crazy for me, even before dope. I really do want to concentrate on health and fitness, and most of all school. But I've been single for a couple of years after getting clean and I've only been on a few dates. 

I'm just not satisfied with life over all. Dope keeps seeming like that old hobby that used to bring me so much piece. I keep telling myself I'll just use a bit here and there and still focus on school, getting the girl and all that. 

IDK if this makes sense.

I spend like 2 hours a day making tea because my habit is so big, I can barely stay well now, takes a ridic dose to nod and i don't even fkn want it anymore. 

 I woke up 2 hours ago and i'm only half way through making my morning dose and i just started typing this instead.  I have a bunch of morphine and oxy there, i'll get to it eventually but fuck it i can't take this much longer.  My whole life revolves around staying well/high when i can afford it.  I work non stop yet i have no money, i can't stop working to deal with my pain because i need paper to pay bills and my habit, i can't stop my habit because i hate my job.  What a fucking cycle it's ridiculous.  It's going to take sooo much work to clean up and deal with my pain without drugs, I know exactly what must be done to escape this shit, it can be done but it's the hardest thing i've ever done.

This cycle, it's nothing but misery and even mid nod there's no satisfaction because i know i'll wake up and need to do it again.  If you're just starting, fucking stop.

I know it effects the opiate receptors and all that, but for example.. it takes me about 200mg of oxy taken at once for me to have a good time. I take opiates strictly once every 7 days (I'm not dependent on opiates,  just have a high tolerance),  using Kratom everyday in between., 8Gs at 2x a day. I do NOT get withdraws in days I don't use either kratom OR oxy.

So 14 days ago I took 200mg. Then, 7 days ago, I take a 150mg dose assuming my tolerance dropped. I thought it was pretty weird that I didn't feel it as strongly as I expected. Yesterday, I take my full dose of 200mg. It's like I never even took 1 day off, as I barely felt the effects. 

Kratom must be responsible for this, right?? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it not strange that kratom is keeping my opiate tolerance at such a high level ?? There's no other explanation for this .... I am pretty shocked. I feel like my opiate receptors are not healing at all.

If you smoke a cigarette after having just put some heroin in your body, the cigarette intensifies the dope high by a lot. Because of my tolerance I literally never get that amazing feeling of slowly nodding out, unless I smoke a cigarette. Then, even if I microdosed, I find myself slowly drifting off. It's such a drastic change that if I'm out driving after having shot up, I have to resist the temptation to light a cigarette - even though I just shot up, I'd be alert and lucid until I finish my cigarette, only then would I start feeling sleepy.
This has happened with such consistency that there must be a scientific/chemical explanation for why this combination has such potent results. Does anyone here know why, or have any theories?",1528591126.0

After waiting in the ER for hours they finally call me back to do a xray, CT and something else. Then I wait some more.

Well around 6 this morning it's about time to get my abscess drained.

I decide to do a shot and sit back on the hospital bed and I fall out.

Shout out to the nurses who did the whole procedure while I was out so I didn't have to feel that pain (anyone who has has an abscess drained know that shit sucks)

Note I was still breathing, just very shallow, slow and my vital signs were low I guess.

Now that they're all done, what do you think they do next?

That's right! Narcan!

This was my first time ever getting narcand.

I jumped out of the hospital bed, confused

""What the fuck is going on?""
""How did I get here""

It was such a weird shitty feeling.
I felt like I could smell my brain burning or something.

Anyway the day I chose to get high I turned into a snowball because I was going down hill fast. Definitely one of my largest binges I’ve ever had. It was mostly the one thing we aren’t suppose to bring up and then dope of course. 

So I got about a week off work to detox like I’ve done multiple times the past couple years. I was worried about going cold turkey this time. I’ve never really been worried whenever I plan to get clean but this time I was having anxiety attacks while I was still using and my depression flared up like a mother fucker. 

So I start the detox. First two days I’m so anxious I barely ate or left my room. My legs are really relentless and I’m having a hard time lying still. I was off a lot of klonopin and dispensary grade bud for these two days so maybe that’s how I got a full nights sleep. Which is weird because when I detoxed off a longer habit, not larger, but more consecutive days than this run, 2mg kpin would knock me out for 4 hours if I was lucky and then I’d be wide awake for the next 20 years. 

Starting day three I started taking two large doses of Kratom. Once when I wake up and another 10-12 hours later. The only WD symptom I’m feeling before the Kratom is restless legs and anxiety. 


From day three to day five I feel pretty much the same. No hot/cold flashes, my bones don’t ache, I’ve been eating like a Samoan which has been great because now my pants actually fit and I don’t constantly like I’m sagging my pants like the cool kids did in middle school. 

Now it’s day 6 and I feel like I’m at baseline besides slight rls and anxiety but I’ve been an anxious fucker my whole life so that’s nothing new. I could probably skip the Kratom from here on out and just deal with the minimal discomfort and I’m going the rest of the weekend benzo free. 

I just don’t understand how this happened and why this detox. JJ couldn’t have blessed me with almost pain free detox that time I was out of state for a week surrounded by family in the humid south, or when I lived with my super protective mother. Who made me go to the doctor because I was so dope sick I couldn’t pass it off as a cold or some shit and then I had to lie to her and my doctor who I’ve been going to for a majority of my life and I think very highly of. 

This has to be the fourth or 5th time I’ve intentionally kicked a habit of these two opiates so I know what it’s suppose to feel like. I can’t remember how long the binge was, no longer than two months, so maybe that’s why it was this easy? Now my last question is, would using put me into some sort of WD worse than what I went through this week? Of course the goal is to not touch the stuff ever again but if I stayed true to that the first time I said that I wouldn’t be typing this post. Sorry for the novel I just haven’t posted on this sub much and even when sober I love this sub

For lurkers and new users you guys need to know that about these opioids and this addiction is that it doesn't fucking go away. Your love for pills and dope will overpower everything else in life and it will fuck you over no matter who you are or where you are from.

Before discovering this sub I thought I was different in the sense that I loved opiates more than anyone else that was the case with everybody I know in real life but my thoughts changed when I started coming on here. I've been on subs the last 8 months with just a few 1-2week benders in between. I've been living a new city and those benders only happen when I visit my hometown. I have no connections here besides for weed and don't do dope anymore and in my opinion I think pills are way harder to cold cop. 

Now I have been away from home for 2 years with going home occasionally and was home all of last summer where I developed a bad crack addiction but that's a story for another day. I have no friends or connections in the new cities I've been living in the last 2 years I can find weed and occasionally stims or benzos but no fucking steady pill connect and to top all of this I haven't been laid since last summer so I'm coming up on a year where I've barely talked to any girls. I have terrible anxiety when it comes to that shit and when I try and go places(20cant drink yet) I can't bring myself to approach anybody and just end up leaving. It's been frustrating and have no idea why I'm like this. I tell myself everyday I'm going to go out and either try and talk to girls or try and cold cop pills and that's the only thing that keeps me sober is that I'm going to do it ""tomorrow"".

Today I was alone my fam actually went back to my hometown and I was pissed I couldn't go with to go scoop 30 blues so I was like fuck it I'm gonna try and score here so after work I went to some methadone clinics and there I saw junkies coming in and out and I couldn't bring myself to approach anybody! Its like how I can't approach girls it's the same fucking thing I left and tried going back but whenever the moment comes I can't fucking do it. Why do I have this horrible approach anxiety of talking to new people. I know the obvious answer is to just go out and fucking do it get over it but I can't. I just have thoughts of getting rejected or called a cop or just being embarrassed and I just go home and smoke bud all day snorting subs eating good food I don't talk to anybody. 

In high school I had a lot of friends and didn't have this bad of social anxiety but ever since I've moved with my fam and I'm not going to school anymore I feel like such a fucking loser everyday I come on here looking at pics of pandas/blues/dope and wish it was me. I guess the tables just turned on me since the end of high school it's such an embarrassing thing to think already that time is the peak of my life so far i used to deal bud go to party's snort blow and hang with girls all the time now I fucking hate myself sit inside all day I'm scared to talk to ppl no matter what I tell myself and really just hate my fucking myself and my life is a joke. 

If you are just starting I would advise to quit I've been hooked over 3 years and had problems with stims and benzos before that just don't be surprised if similar things happen to you as well I see common feelings shared by all of us. Another big thing I can't seem to shake is feelings of envy.  It's burning a whole in me because I can feel the intense jealousy to people who don't have a fucking gorilla on their back telling me to get high all day everyday I dream about this shit is fucking tearing me apart both of my parents and both of our extended families have a history of addiction my parents have the same doc as me and are on subs too. I'm just wired this way although I had plenty of chances to stop I don't I'm definitely  not blaming it on genetics just saying this shit was bound to happen to me.

May I begin by saying I in no way promoting what I'm doing, but saying that my question stems from is it possible to not have physiological dependence on DHC/Codeine after daily use.

I mainly ask as i've been going daily use for nearly 3 months now and 3 weeks ago I cold turkey'd for 1 week, mainly cause I wanted to see if I really was addicted after over 2 months. My daily dose has been 150 mg and since those 3 weeks I've been tapering that down. However, what I noticed was when I went off I didn't experience any of the typical withdrawal symptoms, maybe just being a bit cranky and mainly psychological effects e.g. cravings, does DHC differ in that it's just less likely to cause physical dependency or cause of its half life? Or was it just me not taking massive doses which helped?",1528552416.0

However whenever I do codeine or codeine derivatives, whether it be pills or syrup, I get really really sick. Especially the day after. 

Why is this? Is it because more pills = more shitty filler = bad for your stomach? Or simply because you need to eat a lot of codeine/weaker opiates (300-400mg) to catch a buzz and that ruins your liver and stomach?

I also know of people who experience the opposite, they get really sick on oxycodone but they don’t on other opiates.",1528553396.0

The addiction has been bad for 1 or 2 years now, and I am being given prescription tablets that are not mine. The over-the-counter version (lesser dose) has been banned about 6 months ago, so technically I should not be in possession of codeine at all. SO, this leads to my problem.

I really need to kick this addiction. I know it's not heroin but it's badly affecting my life, and I constantly crave it. The issue is that opiate based painkillers are the ONLY thing that even puts a dent in my period pain. I get extremely severe monthly pain, and without pain relief I would literally be contemplating suicide. It is that bad. It's intolerable.

I am scared to go to the doctor and ask for them to see if there's anything they can do. They will NOT prescribe opiates. I'm 99% sure I have endometriosis, which is causing this pain, but how do I explain how I've been dealing with it?

I liked the legality and thus availability and lack of consequences kratom had. But then my tolerance got so high and I got tired of taking it every day so my friend offered me suboxone to keep me well when I couldn't get any kratom, and ever since then I started taking suboxone. But honestly... I love suboxone. It feels really good to me and I've been using it for 6 years, so I have like a 6 year opiate tolerance under my belt so, I can hang lol. I was taking near 8mg twice a day of subs which I'm now prescribed thankfully. I was getting them off the street but then I almost got caught when they found 2mg strip as I was going to jail for marijuana. I said it was my script, and they never brought it up again. So I got a script after that.
Besides all of this I've always had a very methodical way of dosing and keeping myself at a fairly reasonable tolerance level. I dose twice a day, 3 times max, and it's usually always the same dose. It's worked for me for years.
I also basically just let myself become a drug addict because I had nothing else going on for me after high school. I was all alone I just said fuck it because I was so depressed and in a lot of pain and kratom helped a lot. And I'm still basically totally alone still 6 years later, no gf no friends so that makes it impossible to stop using. I went to a crisis place once to detox and they let me back home in like 5 days and I wanted to get right back to using, but I ended up sticking it out 6 weeks and then relapsing on christmas day. 
I guess this all sounds pretty bad but my parents know and I still live with my dad (at fucking 24) and didn't really work for most of my addiction just hustled, you guys know how it is pawning shit, stealing change, stealing games etc. But I finally got a job a year and a half ago so I'm doing better for myself now and not acting like a ""junkie"". My family I guess still thinks I'm clean, but they probably know it's a lie? I dunno man. I can't make anything of myself staying so high all the time but it's the only way I can handle life, I guess? It's a miracle I didn't try heroin and get addicted to that in my bad phase, I was really depressed and wanted to do it for a while. But I figured I was taking enough of a risk as it is using with my sleep apnea, didn't wanna OD.
The other thing is, I have strong willpower, I can kinda quit whenever I want. I just don't wanna deal with withdrawals right now and I don't have time for it. I've quit plenty of times over the years as I've run out of money or gotten caught or whatever.
So basically what I'm asking, is does this sound typical to you?Or am I different? What do you guys think about this shit? My life I guess? Am I a typical junkie loser just rationalizing my bullshit?

Basically I'm curious how different opiates and opioids feel qualitatively from each other, like how beer and wine can feel slightly different.  For example how does a morphine dose feel compared to an equivalent dose of heroin or hydromorphone? I have no reference point other than kratom, so it might be hard for me to understand but i'm really curious. Is there much difference at all?

The reason I ask is because I have very bad ptsd and when things got bad, well I started not being able to use drugs anymore due to terrible disassociation. Disassociation is linked to NMDA receptors, I cant smoke weed anymore and I can’t drink anymore as they both activate NMDA receptors.

I have a question I have really been struggling with the last couple days and I don't have anyone that I can talk to about this stuff, so here we go.

Am I really sober?

I graduated from college and made a super hard and heart breaking decision to relocate from the Midwest to the west coast. I cried like a little bitch when I had to pack up my diploma and belongings and leave my amazing friend group. I moved to the West Coast because I love the weather, the culture, the women...  I also have a decent job out here. Another HUGE REASON I left the midwest for the west coast is because I wanted to be in an environment where I didn't have access to opiates on a bi-weekly basis. Where I live now, I don't know anyone who does drugs, and that is a good thing. (I still go through intense moments of cravings if that matters)

Anyways, here is the problem. I have been sober for four months and my life is okay right now. Its really boring, but I am working and I am approaching five months of being sober. HOWEVER, I know that deep down, if junkie Jesus presented himself tomorrow.... I wouldn't be able to help myself. If a bottle of pink 10s fell from the sky, I would not have the power to say no. I would be crushing up lines on the sidewalk.

So am I really sober? I out myself in a position where I am living in a nice place, working, and I am technically clean on PURPOSE... But if I was given the opportunity to dance with the Devil again, I would do the tango. ",1528516380.0

And I loved these, in part bcuz I would get them for $10 a pop, bcuz I knew someone who got these rx'd, there first time he told me about them he described them as like morphine, as well as the first time he got fentanyl patches, I agree, that any strong opiate especially heroin, is technically like morphine, especially heroin, or diacetylmorphine.. but I immediately got on the internet and looked up ""Avinza""& to my delight found out they were indeed morphine sulfate extended release capsules:).  I purchased 2/$20 and opened the 1st one up to discover beads inside, @ 1st I was not very efficient at crushing then into a fine powder, but with time became very proficient at it..I'd dump the beads into a shot-glass and had a guitar string winder that's handle was perfectly suited to crushing them up!!  I then would take a $ bill and snort that amazingly bitter powder, and wait for bliss, and even though it would take a few mins to ""come up"" it never failed me! At first, I could do about 75/80% of a 120mg and be high as hell, but unfortunately as w/any opiate, tolerance occurred, and I would do one whole pill per dose, then one and a half, then 2.... I definitely was spoiled with a amazing hook-up.... And payed the price in the long run, physical addiction.  But I then started taking oxy (the OG, ""OC's"", God I'd do unmentionable things to get my hands on a few 80mg OC's again!!). And supplement, that with a nice stay off fent. Patchs I had collected for quite some time.... And then I found opana, then heroin.. at first insufflated, then I.v.  now I love iv heroin probably more than any other opiates, but if I could get those Avinza Cap's again for $10/a piece, I would take them over street H.

They cold turkey'd me off my 2-3g a day heroin habit on top of 120-200mg of methadone, and tapered me off of 60mg of diazepam in 4 weeks. This always sounded impossible to me but now it's done and I'm physically fine. I had to get sent to hospital my first week for lock jaw that was so intense I was fainting and excessive vomiting a few days later. They don't believe in any comfort meds and you're still expected to do duties when you can stand, it's fucking gnarly. After 2 months I'm used to it now, and then pain is gone, but fuck I just don't know about staying sober. 

The thought of never doing heroin again makes me straight up miserable, like I want to recover, I wanna stop ruining my relationships and job opportunities, I want to stop stealing, lying and cheating. I wanna stop living to nod out waking up with burn marks on my clothes and dead cig butts between my fingers, only caring about vinegary white powder. I would actually have to use methadone as well as heroin because heroin in any dose didn't seem to get rid of withdrawal properly. I also had to smoke crack as well to actually feel good not just well. 

But now my minds at, 3 months drug free, not even weed, what will heroin feel like. That first shot, will it feel like the first time? I rationalize that I'm gonna stay sober for a year sort my shit out and then get back to it.. but in my heart I know that it won't be long before I go back. I'm getting drug tested on a random day once a week so I'm already plotting to use straight after my first test. I don't know what's wrong with me.. 

It's like I got my family, my own well being and everything else in one hand and heroin in the other and the heroin hand is winning..

After a 45 minute drive we meet up, he hands me a wad of paper towel, I drop it in my lap and I'm on the way back home again, another 45 minute drive.


Before I hit the major expressway, I realize I need gas. Pull off, hop out and go pay and pump. Hop back in and homeward bound.


I reach my city and stop off at Walgreens to pick up some works. Hop out of the truck and it hits me like a bucket of freezing cold water... those were on my lap earlier when I got out for gas...


Look at my girlfriend and beg her to tell me she grabbed them, plead with her.  Nope. She doesn't have them.


I want to break down in tears. I just drove 45 minutes home, I know they're long long gone. But I have to go check, right? Obviously I have to go check.



Thus begins the longest drive of my life. My mind is racing, thinking of all the coulds and maybes. I keep telling myself, ""why would anyone pick up a wad of paper towel?"", hanging on that thread of hope that just maybe.. maybe..


Finally get off the expressway and I can see the gas station, still fighting with myself. ""they have to be there/there's no possible way those are still there"". I pull in and up to the pump I was at...

*And there they fucking are*, staring at me, wrapped in the most beautiful paper towel I've ever seen. They hadn't moved an inch, incredibly.


Needless to say, it was one of the most exhilarating moments of my life.

Anyway recently I found out that Codeine is sold over the counter with 500mg APAP and 30mg caffeine. I've never heard anyone abusing opiates here, hell no one even knows what they are. Gabapentin is also available OTC, it doesn't get me high at all aside from causing minor CEV's.

So I want to do a Cold Water Extraction to 18 pills, each containing 8mg codeine. If done correctly should I get a minimum of 120mg codeine? Would that be a good dose on its own for a 118 lbs male with zero tolerance?

And most importantly, would Gabapentin possibly potentiate the codeine high? Or would it lower the bioavailability like it would with hydrocodone?

And lastly, assuming I were to consume 120mg codeine, 900mg gabapentin, 540mg caffeine, some APAP leftovers, and 100mg diphenhydramine (for potentiation and possible nausea/itching): **is that too much for my liver to handle at once?**",1528463905.0

I found a few legit dealers that were very low key and used weird code words. Dude was legit but the add was kind of old and only had H now, no oxy.I don’t fuck with H. 

Met some dude in my area who fucked with shrooms, weed and coke. Could maybe get some benzodiazepines but never got back to me. Benzodiazepines interest me, but I have a med card, my girl has an ounce of shrooms and I personally  fucking hate any sort of stims, so it was a no.
Those were the Legit dudes.

The rest of them were the dudes in question living in really sketchy areas. Claim to have every drug under the sun In limitless quantity. Straight up advertising on Craig’s list, no code words or slang. Charging you up the ass, to either get robbed or get ripped off, I assume. 

One of those dudes had lower than average prices but only accepted PayPal or bitcoin but PROMISED he respected the costumer and wold come 14 miles at 1am to deliver as soon as he got the payment. Lmao. What makes me sad is I bet that had worked for him a lot in the past. It’s actually kind of genius. 

Claim your selling drugs. But only accept bit coin or PayPal. Never show up. Easy money. And there’s not much fools can do about. What are you going to do go the cops claiming you got scammed trying to buy illegal drugs? And even if you do, they would get charged with the lesser crime of fraud (does scamming fools trying to buy illegal drugs even count as fraud?) rather than, soliciting a controlled substance.

If you commit a drug relates crime (which all opiate addicts will, unless they die first) and get caught while in jail they will have the opportunity to opt into a drug diversion program.

This program helps you find a job and housing if you agree to attend meetings, drug counciling, and most importantly get the vivitrol shot before release. You must comply with drug testing and get your shot every month for a year..the shot is completely free.

If you breach contract a warrent will be issued for you arrest, if you complete the program your charges will be dismissed.",1528447035.0

Maybe my tolerance went down so 10g lasted me before 2 weeks. Maybe they will last now longer? IDK all I know is that I will relapse. I am planing it in my head all the time. And it will be perfect. I will definitly be out of here next week. So I will relapse next week. Be back in the game and eventually die in the next few months if I keep consuming like that. So fuck it. I cant change myself. The last 1 and 1/2 years nobody recognized my consume. So now when I will start shooting again like I did before I came here I will shoot in hands and foots and no one will see it.

Pick that up no issues, go get some cigs and soda, all smooth sailing. Well she has been playing the shit out of Pokémon Go lately so on our way home we always stop at the nearest gym (a church) and sit for a sec so she can play. 

While she’s doing that I’m crushing some H up. I give her hers to snort, then as I’m getting mine ready I see a cop going up the street in front of us. As he passes by us he slows down...like a lot. As soon as I lose sight of him I just go out on the road, turn left and start going home (this church is 3 minutes away from our apartment complex). I’m on the main road, about to turn right into the street we live on and I see the cop turn onto the road behind us. Shit. 

I put the H in its little container and set it in my door hoping that when the cop sees us pull into the apartments he’ll just go on his way. Instead he decides to stop by the entrance. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. As I’m pulling in I grab the container to hand to my SO and I realize the lid isn’t fully put on so as I’m handing it to her I say the lids not on. She didn’t quite understand what I meant and just put it in the backseat, meaning we have an open container with H presumably spilling all over my backseat with a cop about to stop us. 

I park by our apartment and I don’t see the cop so I grab the keys and start heading inside, not in a hurry as to not look suspicious, when he pulls in, spotlights me, and asks if he can talk to us for a sec. We walk away from our car so we can try to keep his attention off of it. He mentions he saw us pulled over at the church and that there have been “a lot of break-in’s in the area recently” (which there absolutely have not been), but we explain that we live here and she was just playing a game. 

He points out that our tags are expired and gets our licenses to run our names. The second my ID went from my hand to his I remembered I have an unpaid speeding ticket for going 79 in a 65. After a few minutes I see him grab his radio and I know somethings not right. He comes out and informs me I have a warrant, and if the fine I have on the warrant is more than $250 I’m going to jail and I honestly couldn’t remember how much it was for. 

Another officer comes, runs the info and says that because it was only $150 all they need to do is rewrite my bond, raise the fine, and give me a new court date, but I have to go to the station for paperwork. This meant that my SO had to follow me, in the back of a cop car, to the POLICE STATION with a gram of heroin rolling around in the back seat and we don’t know where it is. 

Luckily both officers were cool, filled out the paperwork and immediately went to a nearby parking lot to find my gram. As if everything going well with the cops wasn’t good enough the G was wrapped up in its baggie, wrapped in a sweater and not even a tiny bit spilled. Sorry for the novel but I’m still pretty shaken up, even though nothing happened I was terrified the whole time.

I brokered a deal to sell my only two laptops from this very hotel room/office. And I just smoked my free weed, which was legit... Very legit.

My new dealer looks like a white man in black face and he talked white (first time cold copping basically, got his number on that street waiting for a friend who was copping a few days ago), but I finally have someone to get bags for $5 off of, even just see him for $20. That whole area is watched though, I could see the cops just walking up to us after we meet and greet. It's the area around a city park that's maybe 3 square blocks. And im pretty sure the girl that started bringing me down to that area (she actually took me to the projects up the hill from the commons park and the biggest hospital in that side of town) just got busted down there, she would just cop hard and dip behind a dumpster. I never lived like this and I've been doing opiates daily for almost 15 years, it's crazy how bad I'm pushing my luck. The cops chased me around forever when I was leaving the projects about a week ago. 

I meet this guy on foot by these banks, I parked on a side and then walked up to the main Street corner. He walked up to my car after calling me and opened it as I walked towards him and put the dope in the seat, then he walked towards me, I gave him the cash as we passed. I could just leave the money in my unlocked car, watch him come and go and not even have to approach him.

PS Our situation and condition as human beings -- self aware beings who do relatively amazing things (compared to all other known life), yet we know ourselves to be just a blip in Earth's family tree, and we know earth to be a blip in the solar system, and that in the galaxy, and the galaxy in the Known Universe. The Known Universe, as I recently came to understand it, is not of a knowable size. If light speed really is the limit on how far how fast humans can go, that means that even if we were gifted light speed space ships with ultra powerful telescopes by Jesus or aliens, we would never be able to see much of what's out there or get to it. In fact, with telescopes that could see forever, we could see anything that wasn't moving away from us faster than the speed of light, but apparently quite a bit of the universe is moving away from us at a pace quicker than the speed of light. Yet, within these enormous expanses of time and space, we sit here, as simple mammals, saying I love, masturbating, generating milk, shooting powder from the park straight in our veins (which I thought was nuts when I was starting out snorting), and being sold shit in commercials and standing in our mammalian bureaucratic queues, getting licensed, dealing with painful social machinations that were designed by and for extroverts... So, let's all be really nice to each other.

8pgwqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8pgwqg/my_opinion_of_narcotics_anonymous/,12,https://redd.it/8pgwqg,chrislantern,My opinion of Narcotics Anonymous,"I feel so strongly about AA/NA.  These are not good feelings, I believe NA philosophy is neither medical, nor is it psychiatric in its nature.  It based on ideas that are over a century old that have been proven incorrect.  

It has been medically established that placing certain addicts, such as those who use opiates onto medication such as Suboxone and Methadone will save lives, prevent disease, reduce or eliminate illicit drug use and will be the most helpful thing to prevent relapse. My biggest problem with NA is that I was introduced to it in rehab.  My first stint at a drug rehab was when I was young, about 18 or 19.  This is where I was introduced to the concept of NA and rehabs charging 90k a month to teach you the Big Book.  The big book is AA’s main piece of literature that was written in 1933, and is ultimately what NA is based of.

NA preaches the idea that you are not clean and sober unless you abstain from all mind altering substances, that is including proven prescription drugs that work for opioid use disorder; Bupenorphine and Methadone.  What NA fails to realize is that opiates are a very difficult drug to just give up.  You can be physically dependent on opiates without being psychologically addicted to them.  I knew there was a long period in my usage where I did not want to get high, but had to use to prevent the agonizing withdrawal.

These people are not doctors and will recommend you giving up Medication Assisted Treatment, which is evidence based and proven to work, in favor for abstinence based recovery relying on a higher power? Whatever the fuck that might be to you. Basically pray you stay sober... that’s some real help.

On top of all of this, sometimes when you start to do good, you want to separate from all of this drug shit all together.  The last thing someone who is sober for a while needs is to be placed in a room full of drug addicts talking about getting high.  Someone like me who is on methadone and uses marijuana to treat my pain and opiate use disorder doesn’t care about people talking about war stories.  You wanna stop hanging out with drug addicts, not form a network of a bunch of them trying to piece days together.

I mean AA and NA are a joke, they are not meant to be taken serious.  Addiction is a chronic disease, and should be treated as such.  Which other chronic disease would you attend a support group with others that have this ailment and just put faith in god to get thru it? If you have diabetes you go to a doctor and he gives you insulin. That is a scientific plausible answer, if you have addiction you should also have your doctor give you a medicine.

I strongly believe that not is NA/AA useless, but indeed detrimental to recovery.  Psychiatry and therapy for underlying issue, a long with medication, and yes will power is what you use to beat addiction.  Yes WILLPOWER I said it, NA tell me to admit I am powerless... ugggh I just can’t stand that such smart people buy into that mess.  I feel so strongly about it because people are literally dying because they are not receiving the correct treatment during the opiate epidemic in our country.  

John Doe is doing 20 bags, goes to a south Florida rehab, comes back, relapses and dies.  This story is repeated over and over again.  The South Florida rehab tells John to attend NA meetings and abstain from all substances, including medication to help with opiate use disorder.  John relapses and overdoses.  Has he been on bupenorphine or methadone his chances of relapse would have been GREATLY reduced, and could prevent it by maintaining somewhat of tolerance for the patience, thus relapse isn’t fatal.

Not to mention that tapering down from bupenorphine or methadone is exponentially easier to do than from most full agonists.  It is often said it is harder, while it may be true if one were to stop these medications abruptly, a slow taper is much easier.  This post will be controversial I know, but if I can prove my point to one person, I feel accomplishment.  This is another situation where science is simply right.",1528430927.0

8pgm6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8pgm6j/lord_of_the_bed_bugs/,18,https://redd.it/8pgm6j,sloan_fitch,Lord of the Bed Bugs,"First a theory. All this time, Cliff is like one of those aliens from 'Men in Black'. Under his football jersey, a mass of small creatues -- thousands of bed bugs operating as one unified organism. Cooperating to hold his clothes up in the shape of a man. Perhaps Cliff is still under the mass of bugs but is emaciated. Yes, he appears to a be an overweight male but that can't be possible. His electricity has been off for a month and he doesn't eat three square meals on any given day. To be fair, when he does order take-out the receipt will exceed $60. Last time he order wings with sides the damage was $90. Thus, it is possible he is not an MIB alien masquerading as a human but read on, maybe the evidence will still support that premise.

&nbsp;

He was sitting in my kitchen for just thirty minutes while he waited for a friend to give him a ride to the pharmacy and now bed bugs are making appearances in my kitchen. Three sightings so far in the past two  days. I saw on on my shirt at work so when I got home I stripped down outside and left my clothes on the patio. While eating I saw one on my new shirt so I contained and killed it. Then I saw one on the counter near the microwave. I suspect that the bugs may have gone into hiding inside of the chair that Cliff sat on. I've dealt with bed bugs in my bedroom once before and successfully contained the infestation but it was quite extreme.

&nbsp;

The solution at the time was to steam all of my bed linens and to wrap the mattress in a special cover that traps bugs and prevents more from seekign refuge within. I then sprinked diatomaceous earth all over the place, and made a perimeter. As a result, the powder would get into the joints of any bug that crosses the line. All was well for nearly a year until I started getting a lot of bites on my neck. This time the bed bugs re-infested but could only seek refuge in my fancy pillow, the MyPillow to be specific. It looked like fucking hell, when I discovered that the pillow was infested I immediately sealed it up in a bag likely never to be used again. The rest of my the room and my bed already had copious amounts of bed bug killing powder sprinkled all over. I was sleeping in the stuff for days prior to discovering the scene on the pillow. 

Sidenote: I took some really nice close-up pictures of the bed bugs and their eggs if anyone wants to see. 


&nbsp;


I ended sleeping in a guest room, well not really a guest room... a bed room that was used when we were children. As one of us moved out it was later used by my mom in her late years since it was not on the same level as the bathroom. As the room is was vacant and free of bed bugs I started sleeping there until I got around to cleaning my own linens and verifying that the bugs were gone. The bed bugs seemed to have been mostly in that pillow so once I sealed them off it was a matter of removing the food source from the remaining population. I've been very lucky not to encounter signs of a re-infestation in the guest room that I've been sleeping in. I've spent far less time hanging out at Cliff's house for a few reasons and it bodes well for avoidance of bed bugs getting in my house.

&nbsp;


Now that a couple of bed bugs appeared in my kitchen, the very room that Cliff sat down in for 30 minutes the other day, I know for certain he brought them here. Such excellent hitchikers those bugs are. Why couldn't they stay on his fat ass? Maybe the smell. He takes few showers since his hot water is non existant and bathroom a mess. When he was in my house his stench left a trail that required me to open multiple windows for cross-ventilation. It smelled like cologne masking a unique stench with a strong transient feet-like odor mixed in. A fucking atrocity I tell you.

&nbsp;

Earlier today I reached out to Derrick to inform him about the hitchhiking bed bugs. He called me back to inform me that he went to Cliff's house twice last week to help his mother get back into bed after falling. Afterwards he discovered itchy bumps on his leg and he didn't know why or how they got there. Upon hearing from me his mystetry was solved and he was grateful. Now hat I told him this, he will most likely never help Cliff get his mom off the floor though I suspect that if Cliff has dope or pills and offers them that he would accept under the right circumstances.


&nbsp;



So is Clifford an alien masquerading as a human. A pile of bugs beneath a mask and some clothing. Propped-up atop one another through a cooperative hive mind but due to the smell a couple of them decided to dessert the army of bed bugs. That or there was at least three bed bugs -- large bed bugs hanging on to Cliff's clothing. Excited by the change in fragrances to have the opportunity to jump ship and attempt to setup roots in a fresh new home. Although Cliff's house has proven to be an excellent incubator of bed bugs, they probably don't like the smell. 

Last time I was at his house I peered through the window and saw flies swarming about through the screen. At the time I thought ""lord of the flies"" but now I think ""Lord of the Bed Bugs"" to be a more appropriate title.

&nbsp;

UPDATE:

Finally, due to requests from more than one reader -- [a picture and an animated GIF](https://imgur.com/a/phKQVVQ). The hard to see white pearly things are eggs and the black dots are probably bug feces. Some of the adult bed bugs seem to be freshly dead, others are more active - especially the hatchlings/infants. 

&nbsp;

Lastly I would direct your attention to the dark gray bug on the bottom left. He must've been dead for a bit longer. Just about all of the dead ones were killed by generous sprinklings of the white powder known as diatomaceous earth. The stuff comes from broken seashells (or something like that) and is very jagged at the microscopic level. As a result, the jagged particles get caught in the soft tissue within the bug's joints thereby causing them to perish. Sort of like a person crawling through pulverized glass.

&nbsp;

What's strange is how there seems to be wet spots beneath some of the dead ones, heck some of the dead ones seem to be embedded beneath the surface of the fabric. Yes, this pillow proved quite hospitable but I'm not so sure they would have setup shoppe like this given other options. Since the mattress was already wrapped in an anti-bedbug mattress case they had no way to see refuge within the mattress or any of the seams of the mattress. 

&nbsp;

Prior to discovering the bugs on this pillow I was getting eaten alive along the back left side of my neck. I initially drew a line of dust around myself which is why quite a few were dead by the time the infestation was visually confirmed.

* optional: water, preferably sterile

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, start with a match head sized bump. Redose every 10-15mins until you're at a level comfortable for you. If you click better with numbers, 2mg is a good place to start, too. Keep adding 1.5-2mg every 10 minutes until you get to a level you like.

**How to**

* Put preferred amount of dope on your clean surface

* Cut it into a small bump, or a measured bump

* Blow all of the air out of your chest

* Gently sniff one bump into your nostril, don't sneeze, you're going to want to

* Drip a tiny bit of water down your nose: tilt head. Try not to get too much of a drip. This is going to keep the dope from clogging your nose, among other things.

* Repeat until high

**So you want to shoot heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* metal spoon/ladle/can bottom

* sterile/cool boiled water

* cotton

* cutting device

* 28-31g needle (higher the better)

* 1cc syringe

* tourniquet (shoelace, latex, phone cord)

* lighter 

* citric acid

* optional: scale

* optional: alcohol wipe

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, I'd advise that you do NOT start here. However, make sure your dope isn't cut with fent first and foremost. Start with 3mg. This isn't going to be amazing, it's to be safe. If you can't spare two shots, you shouldn't be shooting. You can always add.

**How to**

* Cut how much and put it in your spoon

* Mix with water (just enough to dissolve dope) and wait for mixture to blend, stir a little

* If you have heroin #3 (Afghan, brown), you need citric acid and a flame to make a solution. Add citric to your spoon and heat it up. Stir.

* Put cotton in spoon

* Look for the hole in the needle. Point it down toward the bottom of the spoon, place it on top of your cotton and draw. (This filters your solution)

* Wash those hands and your arm, or try to sanitize the best you can, make sure to alcohol swab if available.

* Tie off your arm -- don't knot it, here's an instructional: https://youtu.be/e9cUspG74eM -- you can do this one handed

* Feel for a good vein, always closest to the crook of your arm. You will know when you get a good one, they're bouncy. If you can't feel it, look for ones bulging through the skin.

* Enter the vein, hole facing up, needle pointing towards your shoulder, almost parallel to the arm, you'll know when you're in

* Register: pull back and watch the little bit of blood enter the barrel.

* Note: if there's PAIN or TINGLING at any point or no blood registering, pull out and try again. NEVER REUSE A DULL NEEDLE.

* Slam that shit (gently and slowly depress the plunger down). Check again if you're in the vein by looking for more blood. With the needle still in your arm, let go of your tourniquet

* Pull out, gently and slowly. It might sting. Wipe your arm, cap your needle.

**So you want to ~~boof~~ plug heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* an ass

* oral syringe 

* sterile water

* cotton

* lighter

* citric acid

* optional: lube

* optional: scale

**Dose**

Fair warning that boofing is actually strong as fuck. With no tolerance, I would start at 20-30mg. If you know your snorted dose, use that number.

**How to**

* Follow previous shooting steps. Mix your solution, filter it and draw it up.

* Without an oral syringe, you can use a regular needle syringe. Break the tip off. But seriously, oral syringes are everywhere. Pick one up.

* Lube up the tip

* Lay on stomach, or side.

* Slide it in your bung hole (about an inch and a half) and press the plunger down

* Pull out and lay on your side or stomach for 15ish minutes

---

**So you want to smoke heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a short straw

* foil

* lighter

**Dose**

You CAN smoke ECP, but you definitely don't want to. [Guide here if you're stubborn.](https://old.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5vmx3a/first_post_ever_how_can_i_smoke_ecp/de3aym4/)

Stick to tar (and gunpowder. You also need to breathe on gunpowder to make it tar, so you can really only smoke tar.) No tolerance, half a pea size ball.

**How to**

* Tear a strip of foil and fold it in half, tear it in half

* Take one half and make v shape boat thing

* Heat the sides of the foil with your lighter, basically where you're going to make it trail.

* Put BTH in the foil, farthest from the corner you're holding it with and closest to your mouth

* Position lighter several inches under foil, away from the dope. You don't want them to touch, you don't want to ignite the dope. Keep your straw close to ball but don't suck it up

* Inch closer to the dope while heating it, it will liquefy and become smoke. Suck that smoke down, don't make the dope too hot and move the lighter away when the flame dies

*This shit takes practice, not gonna lie..*

**DOSAGE CHART: https://drugs-forum.com/threads/complete-list-of-opioid-dosages.12351/**

Some lingo and wise words.

Afghan, #3 - all the same shit. Powdery heroin that's beige/gray and needs to be cooked with citric.

ECP, #4 - gray/brown powder not cut with fent. Can be grayish and sometimes even a very very dark brown depending on where it's from. Almost never pure white, don't trust that shit.

Brown - refers to both ECP and afghan, weirdly.

BTH - black tar, it's, well, black.

China white - don't fucking buy this if you're a newb. 90% of the time it's just fent with like 2% heroin. Which will kill you.

Fent - fentanyl, will literally kill you with no tolerance.

Always practice harm reduction. Never use needles twice. Never share needles. Use the guides and the health information. Always have Narcan on hand. If your state has a needle exchange, use it. If your state doesn't have a needle law, use the pharmacy. If not, go to the exchange. Ask on reddit, there's tons of us that have spares. Buy them on the dark net. Ask your dboy. Anything. Just stay safe, and don't be stupid, especially with this shit.

And please, if you're starstruck with the glitz and glamor of us heroin addicts, enjoy it from afar. It's hell.

General guidlines: if you live on the west coast: you have tar. East coast: ECP. Europe or dark net: Afghan.

I lost my dad last week to a heroin OD. He had been a user for maybe 6-7 years. He had a period of sobriety about 4 years ago for maybe 6 months. I don't know much about heroin use, but I would say he was a maintenance user? He was functional. Sometimes you could tell he was high but for the most part he was okay.

At the beginning of April, things got bad. I guess he got a bad batch, because he was so stoned that he couldn't walk or talk correctly, kept trying to make calls with the remote, etc. After that, it was all downhill. Even after my mom threw out that batch, he continued to get that messed up with new batches. 

My mom and sister came home to find him OD'd in the garage on May 29th. My sister did CPR until the paramedics got there, but they said he was likely gone for a while before they even found him.

My heart hurts so bad. We tried so many times to get him to get help. He was convinced that because he snorted instead of injecting that he wouldn't OD. You can't admit someone against their will.  We talked about shooting him in the foot just to get him admitted so maybe he would agree to get help if he was already at the hospital. It sounds terrible but we didn't know what else to do. But now there isn't anything we can do. My mom lost her best friend. My sisters and I lost our dad. 

Do you think he knew he was dying? I hope he didn't. He died alone in our garage. I just can't believe I have to live the rest of my life without him.",1528424661.0

For the past year or so, I've been living with my girlfriend and her family and working for her dad. Her and I have been full\-time on h (sniffing only) for a few months now and her family just found out. Long story short, the dad had a collection worth some money we thought he wouldn't miss if part of it went missing, but he did. We both feel horrible about it now, we just thought he wouldn't notice. I made a resolution then to never steal again.

Anyway, I got kicked out of the house and fired from my job (naturally) so I've been living out of my car since then. My mom and I went through something awhile back which is why I was living at my girl's place to begin with, so I'm considering trying to make things right with her. I have the rest of this package to finish, but after that I'm gonna try rehab or detox for the first time and see where I land. I wanna try to reach out to her before that though, obviously too because living out of my car with no money isn't gonna last long.

My mom knows I have been doing heroin for years now while still managing lately to do great at school/work and stay out of trouble somehow, but she keeps bringing up the same ""gotcha"" point about vacations. She wants to take me, my brother, and my sister-in-law with her and my stepdad to either Mexico or Turks and Caicos, and she always points out that I'll either have to stay home, be deathly ill the whole time, or knowingly involve my family in international drug smuggling. I keep telling her that in that hypothetical situation, I would ramp down my use and/or get on subs or something in the weeks before we leave, but  obviously I'd rather just bring some dope without ending up in a Mexican prison. 

**IMPORTANT DETAILS**: I would only be bringing like $200 worth, not a fuckin kilo or anything wild like that. I have zero concern about visual or pat-down detection as I would wrap it in layers of plastic/small ziplock bags and utilize nature's ladypocket. My ONLY fear would be drug-sniffing canines, which I think sometimes walk around airports and stuff. Obviously heading down to the destination would involve transporting significantly more than the return trip to the US, though we would be flying into/out of one of the biggest international airports in the country.

I think to myself ""he'll yeah I just shot the easy load out in my sleep I should be able to tear it up for a good while"" right? Wrong. 

She inserts me into herself and literally, I ejaculated the first two thrusts. Great. We laugh it off as a one off. 5 mins go by and she wants to go again. 

4 thrusts this time until I blow a load. I'm lucky enough to have a girl w a sense of humor but this is still fucking w my head. I'm probably going to jizz 5-6 times today and my gf isn't going to come once. Not fair to her at all. 

Then (bless her heart) she gave me a blowjob. SAME STORY. 30 seconds and her mouth was chalk full of babies. 

This normal for opiates? Have I permanently fucked up the sensitivity of my dickhead. 

I have sense found 2mg of clonazepam to take the edge off. 

Should I just eat her ass tonight to make her feel better?

She wants anal tonight but if I don't score some methadone or smack soon I'm just setting myself up for more humiliation. Wish me luck! JJ please bless me tonight. ",1528409513.0

Some of you may remember my post a couple days ago about being worried about getting cut off for not having paid last month. They allowed me to follow through with my visit today... but something fishy happened. I do a lot of business with a bi polar child’s psychologist, who insists I owe her a ton of money (5000+) for getting me high in times of need. I shared my story with her last night and before I could even tell her, she guessed, and interrupted before I could even explain, 

“Oh they let you walk out without paying too!? Don’t say anything, they did that to me twice and never said anything to me about the money!”

Now, I wasn’t comfortable with that, so that was not my plan. I planned to just ask to speak with the head receptionist in private and let her know what happened and ask for mercy. The receptionist then told me that SOMEBODY told her I had been BRAGGING about not paying. I explained what happened to the receptionist, and she quickly seemed to understand.

Now, this child psychologist bitch is obviously trying to get me cut off. Now, I’ve got half a dozen ideas of how to fuck her over, including but not limited to: her physicians license/board, telling our doctor (I referred her to my doctor when we were still friends), yelp reviews, telling her pharmacy.. I’m thinking I won’t get the doctor involved just in case we both get cut off. I’m curious to see how you guys would handle this, and I’m ready to be petty as fuck.

The best guess was this was caused by sudden weight-loss - 320 to 180 in five months - and is why I've felt like dog-shit since I've lost that weight.)

His posts and the reactions to them had me laughing my ass off.  His passing truly demonstrated how dangerous the dope game could be. At this time I was getting deep into my addiction and his passing may have saved my life.  It made me realize I was not indestructible and that this game can get anyone. As a result I was more careful and practiced harm reduction the best I could. 


The active users have changed over the years with a few staying steadily, but the overall community of this sub has never changed. We are a brotherhood/sisterhood and all share the same trials and tribulations. We all share the same moments of glory and happiness. One way or another we are in this together.  In our day to day lives we might have a person or two (if we are lucky) that we can trust to confide in. Here I have almost 55,000 people that I can confide in, seek advice from, or just bullshit with. People who don’t judge me because I use/used opiates. People who will judge me by the content of my character (as it should be in real life).  I have moved passed my addiction (over 6 months clean). It wasn’t easy as we all know. I could not have done it without this sub and the people here.  Special thanks to Tracey. 

To new users, be careful. We love you. Don’t feel alone, you are not alone. I will be coming to this sub for as long as life permits it.  When I first started visiting this site we had just under 10,000 users, two years later we hit 20,000 users, and another two years later we are about to hit 55,000 users.  That will be 55,000 people who have found harm reduction info, and a community that is not found anywhere else online or IRL.


Stay safe y’all and whatever you want, I hope you get it!

After all:  
What exactly do opioids give me other than the pathetic short-term pleasure shared by that gelatinous blob of a man I see parked by the local McDicks every morning, shoveling greasy bacon wraps into his mouth?  
Will I be pleased with the result of five more years habitual opioid use? 
 I actually enjoy withdrawal for the emotional rawness; love watching nostalgic and generally sorrowful films while in that state; why smother the thing that makes me human?  

I smugly contemplated these questions while easy-access sat in the back of my mind - I can find opioids whenever I feel like taking them, right? Apparently not. And now I am feeling irritated and trapped.  

I want to find a source and build a little stash of something legal so this nagging feeling in the back of my head will leave me alone.

I come just to jot down some stuff that revovery sub is kind of lame honestly but whatever works. This sub got me through the darkest times. I remember being isolated after I coped for the day... high all the time sorting through new posts to just bullshit with whoever.
So ive been clean for 112 days. I stated with that mentality I'm done this the longest I've had aince I picked up around the age of 14, now 27. I started working these damn steps, using people, letting people uss me. Ive done alot of shitty things in this short time. About a month ago my mother was  diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer it spread all over. She passed away last Saturday. 

I'm still processing it all. Trying to remember all the good times but isn't it natural to look back and see how much of a piece of shit I was to her, how I stole lied to her, how I pushed her away. When all she did was one thing my whole life gave me unconditional love and wanted to aee me happy.
I did get to be there for her those last to weeks she was in the hospital. I got to cry with her laugh with her and just be there with her. Ill cherish that. I was never there for her. My mom was my hero she was also an addict and had 7 years clean. She was a detox nurae at a rehab, she helped so many.
I'm still processing all this lots of work has been done and alot more to do.

She left alot to me and its save to say of I pick up ill be dead with this type of money. I can have this house in a safe neighborhood where can start a family. It just all means nothing now, and some thoughts come stronger than ever to pick up even though I doubt I have another run in me.

My mom raised me so much stronger than giving in and that would lead me to disappoint her one more time. I just wish I could have been there that morning before she past instead of sleeping in. I wish I could have told her I love her one more time. I remember people who have lost someone in there family Would tell me if yours is still around tell them you love them. I never did, I dont know why. I dont even know why I wrote this. I just know you guys were part of my family for so long. I always felt comfortable here with you.  You really cared and I cared about you all. So if you have a mother still around give her a call and tell her you love her. I wish I could. I love my mom and I miss her so much.

I can pretty much guarantee nothing will ever top this. Ever. This is a long, long story. There will be no TL;DR because the story is too complex.

Let's start with a little back ground info. I have been apart of the /r/opiates community for years on a my throwaway (not this one, for obvious reasons I made a throwaway specifically for this post. It will become more apparent later). 

I have to use a throwaway when I post on this subreddit because I post on other reddits related to my career on my main reddit and the two just cannot be linked. So what is my job? I am an airline pilot. Yes you read that correctly, I am an airline pilot who enjoys the wonderful bliss that is opiates \- more specifically heroin. My method of use is snorting, I have never injected in the \~6 years of heroin use (and another 2\-3 years before that of on and off hydro/oxy but not using as often as I am with boy). The reason I told you all my job (which normally I never mention anytime I talk about opiates) is it an integral part of the ""Luckiest Day of My life"". I have quotations around that for a reason. Not a good reason.

When I am on trips flying I may do some boy and bring it with me, but I am never super high and nodding off. Just a slight buzz, with the majority of my use coming once I am in my hotel room at night while playing video games on my PC or just watching youtube videos.

Now to the story... I packaged my dope to bring thru the airport with me a little different this time. Normally I get stamps, this time it was weight because my plug is transitioning to bagging himself. He didn't bag it this time so he just gave me weight. I put it in a magazine fold, but it isn't super secure so I thought what I could use besides taping it (which would make it annoying to open and close) to keep it secure. My ""genius"" brain thought it would be a good idea to use tin foil. You might be thinking, ""Metal, are you crazy?! The metal detector will go off in the airport!"". Well two things here, 1) We have this special line that both Flight Attendants and Pilots can go thru called KCM (Known Crew Member). It allows us to use this personalized barcode to scan on the TSA computers which will pull up all our info. This in conjunction with our airline ID as well as either your DL or passport, and you don't have to go thru security so that tin foil metal shouldn't be a problem. 2) Although we have this special line that makes it so we don't have to go thru the body scanner/metal detector or get our bags scanned, every 25th and 50th crew member who goes thru KCM will be randomly selected to go thru the TSA PRE line to get their stuff scanned like a regular passenger. But even if this happened to me, I didn't think tin foil would be thick enough metal to even make the detector go off. I was wrong.

Now, I've been randomly selected for this screening before. It was no biggie, I keep the boy on my person and go right thru. I don't have to go thru the body scanner, just the metal detector. Because my stuff is normally in stamp bags, there's nothing to worry about. I've gone thru metal detector before so I know which things on my person and on my uniform that I need to remove because they set off the alarm. I put everything I knew would set it off thru the machine that xrays our luggage. Well when I stepped thru the metal detector, it went off. It was in this moment that I knew I fucked up... This is also where the shit begins to start hitting the fan.

I play dumb at first not knowing what was making the machine go off. Praying it wasn't the tin foil holding my boy, I start removing items hoping that its something random (but knowing full well it is the foil). I take off my shoes, my lanyard, my belt. You name it, I damn near took everything off except my shirt and pants. Eventually there is nothing left to take off. This is where I make my first of very very few mistakes. I ""remembered"" that I had my keys in my pocket, and told the TSA lady (who will end up being a HUGE cunt and thinks shes a police officer) that I just realized I parked my car in the wrong area (random I know, but I was panicking on the inside a little now) and needed to move it ASAP. She could sense I was nervous and started to think something was up. I asked her if I could grab my bag and leave and then come back once I moved my car. She said because my bag had gone thru already, I had to also go thru the metal detector and grab my bag then I could go move my car. But not until the metal detector gave the all clear. Well it kept beeping and I told her I didn't have anything else on me, but I guess she could see the very small bulge from my pocket where the bag was with the boy. She told me to remove what I had in my pocket. I lied and said there was nothing there. She started to get mad and told me to remove it otherwise she was going to call the LEO on duty. I started freaking out more inside now, knowing full well that I've just put myself in a very bad position. I'm in full uniform here, and its starting to escalate to the point where passengers are looking and it's drawing attention. I keep telling her I don't have anything in my pocket (should have just nonchalantly put it in the bowl from the beginning, but this was a mistake I made). She calls the LEO over on her radio, but before he gets there I take the sandwich bag with the tin foil (boy inside) out and into the bowl. She asks why I didn't remove it before, which I responded with saying I didn't realize a thin metal like tin foil would make the detector go off... She's clearly very suspicious of me now, and the LEO is heading over too. I'm. Totally. Fucked. I spent 8 years, and over 100k\+ becoming an airline pilot. I see my life heading for the toilet bowl, felony charges, parents finding out. 

I go thru the metal detector, this time with nothing in my pockets and now its fine. I get to the otherside to retrieve my items, my bag/shoes/wallet/phone etc. have already come out the other end as this was all going on. The bitch TSA lady heads over to where the computers are (that show whats being xrayed) and theres also a small opening where they can grab what comes out of the xray machine before we the passengers can get our items. She of course pulls the bowl with my sandwich baggie of goodies out. She takes a look at the bag and sees the tin foil as well as a straw. Now she's very suspicious, and brings this bowl over to the table where they swab for explosives, along with the LEO. They open it up, see the straw and start to unwrap the the goodies (are your hands sweating yet? Cuz mine are. Imagine being in this situation, I could have thrown up all over them). They open the package and see this powder, and thats when all the questions begin. You might think that I'm done for it here, but I'm actually great under pressure (remember, I'm a trained airline pilot. We are trained to deal with immense amounts of stress while keeping our cool and making correct decisions). This is where I start to save my own ass. They ask (can't remember who, think they're both asking me questions, both the LEO and the TSA coooont) what the powder is, I tell them the name of something I think is a vitamin (think like, DXX (with the XX being a number, because a lot of vitamins are named like that)). They ask why do I have it in powder form, and that it surely isn't being sold like that from wherever I got it. I tell them it came it capsules, but I have trouble swallowing them so I take it out of the capsules to be able to mix into a drink and take them that way. Whats the straw for? Well when you drink the powder sometimes shit gets stuck in your teeth, I don't have toothpicks laying around so I use that to clear my teeth. I tell them, ""remember guys I'm with passengers all day long and it wouldn't look very professional having gunk in my teeth. They ask why I have this in my pocket, that's kind of strange... I explain to them that my luggage goes into a closet on the airplane where we store our crew luggage, and that if I want to be able to take this vitamin during the day while flying I would have to go in and out of the closet which is tedious and could get in the way of passengers as they board and exit. So I keep it on me for ease of use. The TSA lady isn't buying very much, she tells the LEO how nervous and strange I had been acting about taking this out of my pocket. The LEO tells me hes calling a more experienced officer. He does, and I have to explain everything again to the new officer. Whats the straw for, why is it in powder form... I'll spare you. Well this officer in turn calls more officers over. So now we have about 6 total officers all questioning me and asking me the same questions as I explained earlier. Probably so they are filled in, but also to see if my answers remain consistent (thankfully, my wife loves police/detective shows. You'd think it not useful but seriously I've learned so fucking much from those shows that comes in handy in this whole situation). Eventually they inform me they are getting someone to come bring a drug testing kit, because they aren't sure if this drugs or not. But they tell me they don't want to do it out in public (remember, we are still out in public just standing in the area directly after security where everyone puts back on their clothes etc. We start making our way to the back room.

So they told me just prior to coming back here that they were going to be doing a drug testing panel (or whatever its called) on this. I'm thinking I'm 155&#37; fucked. I won't admit to shit tho, because there's absolutely nothing to be gained by giving myself up. I'm just praying to the gods at this point. My wife always wants me to text her after I get thru security if I have anything on me so she knows I made it thru OK. Well she's blowing up my phone worried AF about me. I have my phone on me so I text her back saying I'm totally FUCKED, and that I'm not joking. I also take the time to quickly go thru and delete any and all drug related text messages. So in the backroom is me and about 6 cops, the TSA bitch doesn't come with, because, shes not a cop you know? Nor is it her job to be looking for drugs, just bombs/explosives/weapons etc. But she took it upon herself to do so. So the cops ask for drivers license, flight info, documents etc. They ask to search my bag, I oblige because I have nothing incriminating in it. At this point I ask them if I was free to go. The one most suspicious of me officer told me no, I was being detained. I'm thinking, oh fuck man this is really bad. They re\-ask all the questions over again, which I can only assume is to once again see if my story is remaining the same. Something weird happens in this situation if you are with police getting questioned for over 10\-15 min. You start to calm down after a while. I was doing a pretty good job up until this point giving quick, concise answers without making it seem like I'm having to sit there and think of an answer. But now after its been quite some time since this all started (probably 20\-30 min), I'm pretty calm even tho I know there's a good chance my life may be ruined. I went into this fight/flight response. I was going to fight, and by that I mean I was going to do a great job of lying and making my story seem believable as possible. So once I re answer their questions again I get some new ones. One of the LEOs says ""You do understand why we would find this suspicious right?"" And I'm like, ""No not really man, why?"" and hes says ""This doesn't look like drugs and drug paraphernalia to you?"". This is where all those cop shows really come in handy. Way too often a person in this situation on TV has said ""Why yes it totally does occifer!"" Trying to like meet him halfway or something. I said ""To be honest man, I don't think it looks suspicious but I don't even know what drugs or drug paraphernalia looks like."" Then this guy said the absolute highlight of my very shitty but weirdly good day. He says ""You see, this looks an awful lot like crack."" I had to contain myself boys. Why? Because this boy was a very nice light brown/tan color. I've never fucked with crack, but I do believe crack is like whitish color not light brown/tan... Another officer says ""Okay man, why don't you just go ahead and tell us what this really is"". I repeat myself, telling him its what I have been all along about it being a vitamin supplement. He finds this strange, saying that he's never seen a doctor prescribe someone powder like this before (all while giving me that cop look that says I'm a dumb asshole trying to make him look stupid or something). I, along with another cop in the room, explain that I said before I got it over the counter and it wasn't prescribed. I explain to him that this was recommended to me by the guy at GNC when I told him that it's hard for me to eat healthy while on the road due to the fact that I eat a lot of fast food. This was suppose to be an additional vitamin source to round out my diet. Additionally, I told him before it came in capsules already crushed but I can't swallow them so I open them up and keep them like that. All while this guy is grilling me with his two other buddies, 3 more are in the other room doing what I think is a drug test on the powder.

Eventually the 3 from the other room come in, and to my very very very very surprise, told me I was free to go... I couldn't believe my ears. I got up and asked if I could put my bag back together since they had taken the stuff out of it and was out on the table. They said yes. On the other table was a small circle bin (that used for wallets, phones etc) with my wallet, belt, and my boy package which was sitting open. They said I could take it all, including my vitamins... I couldn't believe my ears. So I wrapped my ""vitamins"" back up, with 4\-5 cops standing around me watching me (couple had left). Just to seal the deal here, I asked the room if I was going to get an apology now? The room was quiet, one of them changed the subject and told me that I Just needed to go back out to TSA so they could screen my bag again. Well I went and did that with an officer, and sucked up to the TSA lady. Apologizing to her for not just complying originally, and I shook her hand. Once my bag came out of the scanner, I was on my way, vitamins in tow and all. I called in sick for my trip, no way I could fly after all of that.

And that ladies and gents, was how I had the luckiest day of my life. I don't think I will have a luckier day than that for the remainder of my days. 

I do apologize for the length, but in order for you all to grasp this story and the emotional roller coaster, I had to be super detailed.",1528315512.0

Also, preferred ingestion method. I’m trying to compare my current usage to see where I am at in line with everyone else.

I pull out the broken Samsung tablet which for the last 2 years has been used exclusively for breaking down and holding drugs, primarily opiates; same old story, started out with a script of hydro for a compressed disk in my lower back, slowly came to be a good friend of heroin and fentanyl. Upon inspection of the tablet I see that junky-me from the night before only left sober-me enough to be well for about half of the 8 hour shift of hard labor ahead of him, itll have to do. I quickly get dressed, grab my bag, text my boss that I'm omw and head out for the day.

Usually at this point I would smoke a bowl or some wax from my g pipe on the ride to work, however finances have been tied up elsewhere lately. I finish the 15 minute drive to my boss's house, essentially sober, and we begin discussing crews for the day. Once I see the roster of workers for the day I immediately know which team I'm on. N is the crew lead of my team and for a good reason; our team all love to get fucked up. Before we even begin discussing the nature of today's jobs N informs me that we have an eighth of some very dank weed as well as adderall. Fucking right. N stops me and says eventually I have to get him back for bringing the drugs. I remind him of the 6mg of klonopin I gave him a week ago, empathetic to him not remembering, having taken them all at once. 

We finalize jobs and teams and start to head out for the day. N takes out a bag of about 15 Adderall 20mg IR pills before we get off the street. ""One each. I'm being stingy today,"" N tells us as he hands the bag over to me. No problem, adderall hasn't even been on my radar since starting using dope about 6 months ago so anything is a nice surprise. I ask N if he could get more of them and if he can get anymore klonopins. ""Well I was being extra stingy with these, I need my downers more than the adderall,"" he says, revealing another bag with about 8 2mg Klonopin tablets and says ""just one, and only for you since you hooked me up before,"" today is starting to look up.

I immediately swallow the small dose of benzos, hoping it would do absolutely anything to potentiate/increase the duration of the joke of a line of dope I had to start my day. Once the Kpin goes down the hatch I immediately begin the familiar ritual of crushing the adderall pill with the bottom of a bic lighter onto the screen of my phone. It had been a long while since i crushed a pill to snort but it still felt like second nature. Cover, crush, flatten with lighter, chop; your line is ready. I start on the multiple attempts it takes to finish snorting the adderall. I know itd be easier to just swallow it since you lose 80% of it to drip anyway but at this point I was more satisfying the junkie urge of using my favorite ROA, something I'm sure people here can relate to.

We arrive at one of the giant truck stop/gas stations that have been popping up everywhere so that we can get drinks, smokes, gas, etc. As usual we all seem a bit discoordinated in the back of the store fumbling around trying to find the cheapest combo of drinks to satisfy the 4 of us. Check out is just as awkward. As soon as we finish pumping gas, assistant crew lead, D, starts rolling a blunt. D can be a bit annoying at times but is overall a good solid guy and he gets some very high quality bud and wax which can be somewhat hard to come by in a state as anti marijuana as ours. We head out and D sparks the blunt of top shelf sativa dom hybrid.

We start passing the blunt, everyone agrees we're starting to feel the adderall and today is starting to look like a great day. Even with the tiny ration of dope I had to get me through the work day I have to admit, I was starting to feel pretty good. We all start having conversations, mostly about drugs and I thank them for helping almost achieve my ultimate combo of drugs, I tell them I wish I had more ""opiates"" however to finally top it off. I say ""opiates"" specifically because everyone here has a very negative opinion of heroin, seeing as N's brother OD'd and died on it. Even around other drug users a dope fiend has to be careful and discreet.

We drive for a while, the whole time I can feel the Adderall slowly ramping up to the smooth amphetamine high I had once been so familiar with. I had eaten a hot breakfast sandwich to aid in the digestion of the klonopin from earlier. The long onset is my least favorite part about klonopin other than the constant redosing and blacking out.

As I start to feel the haze of the clonazepam wash over me and combine with the pseudo-speedball effect I realize that if I hadn't been so greedy the night before I could be in a state of bliss for the day but maybe its best that things worked out this way. Tonight is payday and I can get even with my dope man and finally get a decent bag of boy, even if it's on a front, just to repeat the cycle with.

About six months ago, I found a very compassionate pain doctor; started me off with 90 10 mg oxycodone per month, and bumped me up to 90 15s the very next month; in fact, I’m due to get bumped to 60-90 30s next month. Problem is, I’m broke; this doctor only accepts cash, and gives you the boot if you miss two appointments; this will be the first visit I have missed outright, but I had to cancel one month previously because, just like this month, I didn’t have the money. I’m very worried, because being that I’m very young, I don’t think I’ll ever get as lucky with finding another doctor again.

To top it all off, I have a very large settlement check coming in two to three weeks from a bad car wreck, I just don’t think it’s at all likely they will let me slide on paying for a few weeks. Normally, I get a bit of help in paying for most, of not all of my script; however, this month, my usual benefactors are unable to help also.

Guys, I really don’t want to lose this doctor, please cross your fingers and pray to junkie Jesus for me. I’m really stressing here. I promise, if this somehow works out, I’ll do a few extra in script day just for you guys.

I only have $25 in my pocket, I'm freakin out, wondering how I'm going to get money! I start Googling about how to get a cash advance on a credit card, because I've never done it before. So, they (citibank, where I have the credit card through) tell me all I have to do is go into ANY bank with my credit card and ID and they will hand me money! 
Cha-ching! 😍
Except... They denied it LMAOOOO! I asked for $140 and you can only get $50 on that particular credit card, and I didn't have any of my others with me! 😱😭😱😭 (you can even get cash advances on a Walmart credit card, I did not know this! Not at the bank, but still lol) 

My lady is blowing up my phone wondering where I am! I'm sweating in the bank, trying not to cry lol!! And then, I remember PayPal Credit!! I check my bank account to make sure there is SOME money in there, and there is, thank you JJ lol. 
I transferred money to one of my internet kids with instructions to send all but $20 back to me, ($20 for her trouble!) and then I transfer that from PayPal to my bank, withdrawal most of the cash that's in the bank and call my lady.

She said she's at the welfare office and to meet her there, but I have to come in because she can't miss her number being called?! So she wants to sell me pills in the lobby of the medicaid office! 😱😂😱😂😂😂 Anxiety kicks in full force, I know they probably have security and cameras in there!!! But... 
LIKE I'M GOING TO SAY NO!! 
I get crazy looks parking at the welfare office in a brand new Camaro, someone asked me if I worked there as I got out of my car!! I have insane anxiety with no opiates in my system  and I don't wanna talk to you, lady!! No, I don't work here, I'm here for a drug deal! Lmao! 
I get inside and she's talking to someone who hands her a clipboard with papers. She sees me and hands me her purse and says, ""can you find me a pen mama? In the side pocket..."" so I see the crumbled up napkin in the side pocket, I know the pills are in there, I take them and replace them with the money, including her finder's fee lol, and then hand her a pen out of her purse, hug her and leave. 😂😂😂 Not as scary as I thought lol. 

Anyway, thanks for reading that ramble... Now, some info!! If you have a PayPal account, linked to your bank account... Apply for PayPal credit! They gave me a THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT LIMIT!!! I've used most of it for pills, honestly, but... If you have someone you can trust, it's an easy way to get money into your bank account if you need money in your bank account!! The minimum payment is like $50 a month, and paying even the minimum keeps my credit looking good. 
I send money to one of my internet kids, with a little extra for her, and she immediately sends it back to my PayPal account, and then I transfer it to my bank. If you send it via ATM card, at some banks, it only takes a few minutes to show up in your account. My bank is super anti fraud and safe etc, so it takes 24 hours for it to show up. But, thankfully, there was some money in my bank and I didn't have to wait 24 hours lol. But, the money will be there tomorrow (I've done this before) and nothing is scheduled to come out of the bank until next week, so leaving only $25 in there is ok and husband can't get mad at me lol. (I'm hoping he doesn't get mad anyway, I'm about to go wake him up Lmaoooo) 

If you have any questions about PayPal credit, feel free to ask!! And, if you shop online, you can use a PayPal balance for most things online as well, without transferring to your bank, so this could be helpful for some of you who use the darknet or whatever it's called! 

Sorry for the long post, I'm very happy that my anxiety is gone and I can get some shit done today instead of crying in my bed watching Netflix and checking my heart rate all the time lol. Fuck anxiety! 
I hope you're all doing well. Stay safe and happy nods! 💖💖

I will be going out in a min to get my friend from work maybe I could stop by a store and get fake urine or a detox. IDK. But I'd rather do the bleach thing.

The other day I got super sick because the bags I had the day before weren't good so I got sick fairly quick. Woke up at 4 AM and couldn't fall back asleep so I had to occupy myself til 9 AM til I could get to the bank cuz I lost my debit card.... It was pretty damn shitty and even driving out to the hood I was thinking to myself, ""I can't do this!"" But once I started to get close, I got that motivation going and pushed onwards. Once I got those bags, I immediately got to work ripping em open to ingest that wonderfully evil powder... **(Side note: When you're sick, you get reckless like that- everyone knows it. I don't think anyone can say that they haven't at least ONE TIME gotten high immediately after picking up the dope, whilst still in the hood, even if it's not a good idea. You can be the most careful person and be super strict about not using in the hood, but you know there's been that ONE time that you just couldn't wait.)**
Anyway, I digress. Like I was saying, I ripped open those damn bags, driving with my knee and all, dumped out three, and sniffed em. Even though I didn't feel them yet, my mind was completely at ease. A few minutes later I felt all of the sickness melt away and could go on with the day.

As much as I hate it, that damn relief going from sick as hell to well is amazing. But I was thinking.. how could you explain that to someone that has never been through it? It's pretty easy to explain how it feels to be sick, and how it feels to be high. But how do you explain that sweet feeling of relief? How can you put that into words- that moment the opiate hits your brain, and all of your sickness goes away, and all is right with the world for a little while once again?",1528244144.0

This came to mind because I signed up for uber recently. I don't like people enough to put them in my car but they have a delivery service and thats what I've been trying when Im not up to anything else. Its pretty dope and easy and pays well. I did 3 runs this morning over a 40 minute period that paid a total of $24. So thats in the $30/hr range and they have an instant pay out option so naturally I tried that because who doesn't like instant cash. 30 mins later it was in my account.  I'll also do MTurk on amazon when Im bored and that also ends up in the bank the next day when you cash out. 


So thats me for legal hustles. What about you?",1528243349.0

Some sort of someone is screaming to someone else that they knew the dope was fucked, see look he's dying, fuck dude you can't just leave me here I don't have any money he's gonna be pissed when they wake him up man, and I giggle.

That's what happens when you practice dying. 


The Walk Sign Is On for Fourth Street and I can't stare anymore. A shot of Narcan and a sternum rub got him off the ground and slouched up against a wall, alternately squinting towards the opposite street corner and back towards me again. I can't look him in the eye. I might see my old friends peer out from his pinpricked pupils or let the smell of stale Marlboro reds, cheap red wine, unwashed hair, and thrift store leather bring them back to life again. Fuckers. Fucking assholes. You're not supposed to do this to me anymore. It's not my fault I tried to help but who was I compared to your precious fucking powder it wasn't your fault though it's just the drugs I love you too. 


Blinking at the sun through prickly tears, I gag on all the apologies, the impassioned pleas, the stoic rebukes, and the tragic last goodbyes that I've come up with in the last 13 years, but it's what came out of one of the EMTs-- some pud-mouthed paragon of mediocrity-- that made me vomit.
